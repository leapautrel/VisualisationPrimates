3338689,12375,Loris tardigradus,Endangered,C2a(i),2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Endangered because its population size is estimated to number fewer than 2,500 mature individuals, there is an observed continuing decline in the number of mature individuals, and no subpopulation contains more than 250 mature individuals.","<em>Loris tardigradus tardigradus</em> is found in wet lowland forests (Schulze and Meier 1995), tropical rain, swampy coastal and evergreen forests, and wet zone lowland forest up to 470 m (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003). <em>Loris t. tardigradus</em> has only been observed to eat animal prey. Although they will eat fruit in a captive setting, they will always choose animal prey first. In addition to insects (including moths, stick insects, dragonflies, beetles, cockroaches, grasshoppers), they relish lizards and geckos. At Masmullah Proposed Forest Reserve, lorises were found in high abundance in areas characterised by <em>Humboldtia laurifolia</em>, a tree that has a mutualistic relationship with ants, providing abundant food for lorises. Lorises occurred at densities of 0.08-0.55 animals/ha across 15 separate sites. Loris abundance was positively associated with vines and branches providing continuous passage, branches of small size (&lt;5 cm) and trees providing a number of potential sleeping sites. Vicinity to human populations negatively impacts this species; it is not found in home gardens, and seems to require continuous canopy to move between forest patches.<br/><em>Loris t. nycticeboides</em> may possibly be more carnivorous than the lowland subspecies. As is this case with other primates at high altitudes, it also may occur at lower densities. The forest where it occurs has been classified as cloud forest, montane forest and evergreen forest at altitudes greater than 1,500 m (Schulze and Meier 1995), from 1,650 to 2,000 m (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003). Of actual sightings, the highest was at 2,134 m and the lowest at 1,829 m altitude. Temperatures in its habitat have been recorded from 15.4°C (May/June) to -4°C (Dec/Jan) (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2003; Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2005; Nekaris and Bearder 2006).","The threats imposed by humans on Sri Lankan <em>Loris</em> include habitat loss, road kill, and hunting for the pet trade, traditional “medicine,” and superstitious killing. Also, lorises have been electrocuted on un-insulated power lines. <em>Loris t. tardigradus</em> exists in few isolated forest patches that are also under severe encroachment by humans. Recent population studies estimate low numbers in forest patches and it is evident that both subspecies are in decline (Nekaris 2003, 2006).<br/><br/>Molur <em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for <em>L. t. nycticeboides</em>: “land and water pollution, habitat loss due to agriculture, dairy husbandry, and vegetable cultivation, as well as local and commercial trade for eyes and meat by tea plantation workers, and possible village level trade for folk medicine”. While for <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> major threats are: “deforestation due to urbanization, and local, domestic, and commercial trade for meat” (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003).","All populations are thought to be in decline. Population estimates suggest that there are approximately 1,500 animals of <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> in 3,000 ha of extremely fragmented forests, and about 80 animals in Horton Plains of <em>L. t. nycticeboides</em>. According to Molur <em>et al</em>. (2003) the total population of <em>L. t.</em> nycticeboides is unknown, yet this species has declined by greater than 80% in the last 200 years and is predicted to decline by &gt;20% in the next 10 years. <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> is predicted to decline by greater than 10% in the next 5 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). These declines are based on the 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number. The country has lost 97% of its forest cover (Mill 1995; Myers <em>et al</em>. 2000), thus dramatically reducing the population.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to central and south-western Sri Lanka, and is typically found in the southern “wet zone” of the island, up to the central “intermediate zone” (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004).<br/><br/><em>L. t. tardigradus</em> <br/>Found in south-western Sri Lanka, from Colombo (although no known population still exists in this city) in the north to Ranna on the south coast.

Despite living in these areas, the survival of the species depends on reduction of habitat loss and the concurrent establishment of corridors between forest fragments. The eradication of local reliance on lorises for traditional “medicine” and use as superstitious scapegoats can only be achieved through education (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004). Reliable population estimates and a monitoring program are needed for all Sri Lankan loris populations.<br/>Molur <em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following necessary research actions for this species: genetic and taxonomic, life history, population surveying, epidemiology, trade, population genetics, limiting factors, behavior and ecology.

The populations of this species are now extremely fragmented, and are increasingly restricted to karst areas which are under increasing threat due to cement mining.","In the north of its range this species is found in rainforest as well as deciduous forests and karst islands, while in the southern parts it tends to occur in mosaics of forest with some grasslands, probably due primarily to habitat availability. They occur below 2,000 m. It is diurnal and frugivorous, but will also consume leaves and arthropods. Females reach sexual maturity in 6-7 years, and inter-birth intervals averaged 32 months (Okamoto <em>et al.</em> 2000).","The major threat to moor macaques and other Sulawesi macaques seems to be habitat disturbance and fragmentation (Evans <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species is poisoned and trapped by local farmers where they are considered crop raiders. Increasing human settlement has marginalized the species to karst areas that cannot be developed. However, cement mining is destroying these areas and may be a serious threat to all species persisting in karst in the near future. These animals are frequently kept as pets by local people.","From 1983 to 1994 population estimates for moor macaque apparently went from 56,000 individuals to under 10,000 (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2001), but they may or may not still be in decline. However, the survey methods used in these two population estimates were different, and the level of decline over three generations is more likely to be between 50 and 80%, than greater than 80% (J. Burton pers. comm.). The well-studied population that lives in Karaenta Nature Reserve reached a density of 70 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> as of 1998 (Okamoto <em>et al</em>. 2000).

In Bolivia, it occurs east of the Río Mamoré, in the Departments of Beni and Santa Cruz (Brown and Rumiz 1986; Anderson 1997).<br/><br/>According to Hershkovitz (1977), in Brazil it occurs to the east of the Rio Madeira, from the mouth of the Rio Aripuanã extending south to beyond the Rio Guaporé and west to the Rio Roosevelt. However, field research and the discovery of a number of distinct new marmosets has modified the range he proposed. In the state of Rondônia evidence has not been forthcoming for its occurrence between the Rios Aripuanã and Roosevelt (the range of <em>M. intermedius</em>). It does occur on the east bank of the Rio Aripuaná, north at least to 10ºS, and probably west to the Rio Juruena, or the Rio Teles Pires, where Ávila-Pires (1986) predicted that it would meet the range of the form <em>M. emiliae</em>. Hershkovitz’s (1977) proposal for its occurrence west of the Rio Aripuanã-Roosevelt was based on three localities. The first was the Foz do Rio Castanho (near the junction of the Rios Roosevelt, Guariba, and Aripuanã in the state of Amazonas) (locality 197b, p.569, Hershkovitz 1977).

In addition, some animals may be entering the pet trade. There has been extensive loss of habitat; however, the species has some tolerance to forest conversion. A crucial unknown variable in determining how critical the threats to this species are is its elevational distribution.

They are seasonal vagrants and move to different areas of the forest tracking the seasonal variation in availability of preferred fruits. They forage at different levels from the understory to the canopy, but they have never been seen descending to the ground. All uakaris are specialized seed predators and the majority of their diet is made up of immature seeds. The diet can be supplemented by fruit pulp, leaves and arthropods.

Although the consumption of primates and other game by the Yanomamis might have been sustainable in the past, the advent of permanent (missionary encouraged) settlements, and subsequent population increase and use of shotguns are now drastically affecting primate numbers near indigenous villages. Once abundant along the Canal Maturacá (a natural channel that connects the Cauaburi River in Brazil with Canal Cassiquiari in Venezuela), Black-headed Uacaris are now a rare sight in this area. Lehman and Robertson (1994) reported that Black-headed Uakaris were hunted heavily by both illegal Brazilian goldminers and local people and may have been eliminated from much of their range in southern Venezuela.

They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet. The dentition of the tamarins (<em>Saguinus</em> and <em>Leontopithecus</em>) does not provide for gouging and they eat gums only when readily available. <br/><br/>Tamarins live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals, but usually 2-8.

Like all tarsiers it shows extreme adaptations for vertical clinging and leaping (VCL) in the understory of suitable tropical habitats, often 0 m or less from the ground. Nocturnal social primates, they likely live in small, monogamous or polygamous groupings of 2-7 individuals (Merker 2003). Home range sizes have been recorded as 1.0–1.8 ha depending on habitat type.

We currently know next to nothing of the species; thus, it is recommended that it be reevaluated periodically as more information is gathered and as development pressures change on Sulawesi. Because of the small extent of occurrence (3,700 km<sup>2</sup>) and the fact that these are severely fragmented populations, the species could possibly qualify for Endangered under criterion B1ab(i,iii,iv,v) if it could be demonstrated that there is a continuing decline due to reduction in extent of occurrence, habitat quality or number of individuals or subpopulations. However, there is currently only localised, small-scale exploitation of the habitat, with limited impact so far. The nature of the montane habitat is such that is remains extremely remote, steep and difficult to access, and so Least Concern is also a plausible listing for this species. What little is known of this species is that it is a small-bodied (approximately 60 g), montane form, endemic to moss forests between 1,800-2,200 m asl. The fact that only three specimens have been found does not presuppose that the species is rare, and if compared to similar small-bodied mammalian taxa, the most likely assumption is that relatively large populations remain.  Likewise, comparisons with other nocturnal primates, such as <em>Daubentonia</em>, indicate that such animals can persist relatively unobserved for long periods of time.","This species has never seen alive by scientists for long time, and is among the least known primates in existence.

Moss forests are characteristic of the presumed habitat.","The distribution is in all likelihood fragmented on isolated mountain tops. One threat to these habitats is the encroachment of human populations into montane regions to satisfy the needs of a growing human population. The destruction of montane forests in more densely populated south Sulawesi indicates that this fate may well be in store for Central Sulawesi's montane forests as the human population expands.

This is particularly true since, owing to the conservation threats to some of the smaller populations with restricted ranges, there is the possibility that they may go extinct before they have even been named. This is turn argues in favor of the most conservative conservation estimate that can be justified for <em>T. tarsier.</em>","<em>Tarsius tarsier sensu stricto</em> has not been the subject of systematic study, but by analogy with wild tarsier populations studied at Tangkoko and with <em>T. dentatus</em> at Lore Lindu National Park, it is expected that this taxon is found in primary, secondary and mangrove forests, forest gardens, and a variety of other habitats of varying degrees of human disturbance that provide adequate shrubby cover. It shows extreme adaptations for vertical clinging and leaping (VCL) in the understory of suitable tropical habitats, often 2 meters or less from the ground. Nocturnal social primates, they likely live in small, monogamous or polygamous groupings of 2-6. The home range is believed to be less than one hectare. Its diet is 100% live animal prey, mostly insects with some small vertebrates.","Major threats include habitat loss due to agriculture, illegal logging, mining of limestone for cement manufacture, agricultural pesticides, and predation by domestic animals (dogs and cats). Some animals are entering the pet trade (particularly from North Sulawesi, around Tankoko). Although there has been extensive loss of habitat, this species, however, has demonstrated some tolerance to forest conversion. Although seemingly among the least threatened of tarsiers owing to its relatively wide distribution, the possible existence of undescribed cryptic species makes it likely that some populations are more threatened than others. This species should be reassessed upon further taxonomic revision.","Within <em>T. tarsier, sensu lato</em>, the best studied population comes from Tangkoko, which is at the extreme northeast peninsula of Sulawesi, whereas Makassar, the type locality of <em>T. tarsier sensu stricto</em>, is at the extreme southwestern peninsula, and has not been the subject of systematic study. Population density estimates at Tangkoko are 70/km<sup>2</sup> (MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980) and 156/km<sup>2</sup> (Gursky 1997). Merker (2003) estimated population densities for <em>T. dentatus</em> in a variety of pristine and human disturbed habitats near Kamarora, on the edge of Lore Lindu National Park. The values he calculated were 270/km<sup>2</sup> in pristine habitat, 190/km<sup>2</sup> for slightly disturbed, 130/km<sup>2</sup> for moderate disturbance, and 45/km<sup>2</sup> in heavily disturbed habitat.",Decreasing,"By definition, <em>T. tarsier</em> is the rump taxon of tarsiers that remain in the Sulawesi biogeographic region, after excluding <em>T. sangirensis</em>, <em>T. pumilus</em>, <em>T. dentatus</em>, <em>T. pelengensis</em>, and <em>T. lariang</em>. This leaves <em>T. tarsier, sensu lato</em>, with an unlikely distribution that includes Sulawesi, Buton, Muna, Kabaena, Selayar, and the Togian Islands, below 1,800 m (with an actual vertical distribution that likely stops somewhere between 1,100-1,500 m), except those portions of Sulawesi that lie within the ranges of <em>T. dentatus</em> and <em>T. lariang</em>. As discussed by Brandon-Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004), this is distribution is improbably disjunct.

One major driver of habitat loss is the clearing of forests and forest gardens for more intensive agriculture where underbrush is cleared, such as coconut monocrop, coconut/chocolate, nutmeg, and others (M. Shekelle pers. comm. 2010). Riley (2002), however, did not think that habitat loss was a major threat, given their presence in a variety of secondary habitats. This discrepancy emphasizes the need to determine the suitability of secondary habitats for sustainable tarsier populations. The volcano on Sangihe Island, Mt Awu, is active and one of the deadliest in Indonesia, and the human population density on the island is very high (260 people km<sup>-²</sup>) (Shekelle and Salim 2009).

Riley (2002) estimated population size as 9,000–15,600, but those numbers drop to 300-500 if secondary habitat is excluded. Riley did not address the issue that, while tarsiers are recorded in secondary habitats, these might not support sustainable populations.

This implies that perhaps as little as 9% of the original habitat of the island remains in good condition. Therefore it seems likely that, while we know little about this species, habitat loss through slash and burn activities is a major threat. On the other hand, it is not clear that “good” habitat is also compatible with the needs of tarsier conservation. All species of tarsiers that have been studied in the wild are recorded in a number of non-forest habitats, but it remains an open question as to whether these habitats are suitable for sustainably-reproducing populations. GIS also provides an estimate of 1,474 km<sup>2</sup> of “fair” habitat remaining on Pulau Peleng. Together with “good” habitat, this yields a total of 1,685 km<sup>2</sup> of habitat that is potentially suitable for tarsier conservation, a figure that represents slightly more than 72% of the island’s total area. In other words, the estimate of the percentage of the original tarsier habitat that still remains on Pulau Peleng varies from 9 to 72%, depending on whether “fair” habitat is included in the model.

This species experiences a considerable range in elevation of near sea-level in the south to above 3,000 m in the north (Wangchuk <em>et al.</em> 2003). One isolated population is found in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, Nayakgaon, in the Kokrajhar district of Assam (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Study of this population has shown that the animals can withstand the effects of habitat change to some extent and survive in altered habitats (Medhi <em>et al</em>. 2004). The diet consists of young and mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits, and seeds, with most feeding spent on young leaves (Gupta 1998, 2002). Subba (1989) and Subba and Santiapillai (1989), however, found that this species prefers fruits and buds to leaves. In forest fragments they may depend on cultivated crops such as tapioca, betel, and guava. It is diurnal and arboreal (Khajuria 1977).","Due to habitat destruction, the populations of this species are restricted to fragmented forest pockets, especially in India (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Habitat destruction is the major threat to this species in India (Medhi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava <em>et al. </em>2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and woodcutting have severely affected these forest reserves (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.<br/>Molur <em>et al</em>.

Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J.

In the first long-term study of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. oenanthe</span> (undertaken in an isolated fragment), a group of five monkeys (an adult male and female and their three offspring) used an area of 2.5 ha (DeLuycker 2007). This group’s diet consisted mainly of insects (45%) and fruits (39%), although young seeds, flowers and non-reproductive plant parts such as leaves, shoots and tendrils and new meristem were also eaten (DeLuycker 2007). Liana species were particularly important in the diet, as were fruits from stem-parasitic plants from the mistletoe family, and the group spent a considerable amount of time foraging for insects (DeLuycker 2006). In contrast with Titi Monkeys at other sites, the group used only three sleeping sites during the entire study. They shared the fragment with saddleback tamarins [Saguinus fuscicollis leucogenys] (DeLuycker 2006).</p>","<p>The main threats to this species are habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting pressure. The region has suffered intense human colonization over the last 30 years because of a major agrarian programme, which has attracted huge numbers of immigrants. Agricultural activities include the cultivation of rice and coffee; cattle ranching and selective timber extraction also occur. The region is characterized by rapid rates of deforestation (estimates vary from 40,000 to 100,000 ha per year) and fragmentation, and has lost at least 40% of its forest cover, mainly from the low-altitude river basins (the preferred habitat of this species) over the last 20 years (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006). The construction of a two-lane all-weather road, which was asphalted in 2003 - La Carretera Marginal, Via Marginal, or Carretera Fernando Belaunde Terry - which runs all the way to the coast (Chiclayo) and past Tarapoto has contributed to the influx of immigrants and a change from subsistence to small-scale farming. It has also altered the spatial distribution of human settlers, who now follow the highway far into the valley and high forests, and the lack planning or state-regulated land occupation and use puts protected areas and remaining forests at risk (DeLuycker 2006).<br/> <br/> The species is not found in any large protected areas of San Martin. Recent studies (Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009) determined that an estimated 60% of the species original range has already been lost, and its current range comprises only small fragments of secondary forest. All groups encountered live in small highly degraded remnants of forest, isolated from other populations. The species is being hunted for its meat, both the Aguarunas and recent immigrants hunt this species (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006, Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). While Titis Monkeys may not be a particularly lucrative source of protein, hunting pressure is likely to increase as preferred game become scarce and fragmentation facilitates access. These Titi Monkeys are popular as pets (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006, Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009) and have been found for sale at markets (Rowe and Martinez 2003, Mark 2003) and encountered along with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Aotus miconax</span> at tourist centres in the upper Mayo valley (Mark 2003).</p>","<p>A few short surveys were undertaken (Rowe and Martinez 2003, Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006) and interviews conducted with communities of Aguaruna Amerindians to confirm the presence or absence of the species in different parts of its range.</p>  <p>Aldrich (2006) undertook a song-based survey of a population at Tarangue (a 74 ha private reserve near Moyobamba) and estimated a population density of 1.4 individuals per ha. Group sizes were unusually large for Titi Monkeys, with 20% of groups containing six to eight individuals. Rowe and Martinez (2003) carried out a four-day survey, and although they did not observe the species in the wild, they heard several groups of Titi Monkeys (presumed to be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. oenanthe</span>) vocalizing in a forest remnant at 925 m. They photographed a family being sold at a local market that had been captured near Rioja. Mark (2003) carried out surveys at five sites and observed monkeys in fragments as small as 2 ha (804 m asl).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Until 2007, this species was thought to be endemic to the upper Rio Mayo valley or Alto Mayo (Hershkovitz 1990). However, a recent study by Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, undertaken over six months at 96 localities, revealed that its distribution extends much further to the south of the Department of San Martin, extending into the Bajo Mayo and Huallaga Central, almost reaching the Rio Huallabamba (known locally as the rio Huayabamba). This area is heavily deforested, and to date only one area was found where a viable population might live, although further research is needed to confirm this.</p>    <p>Mark (2003) and DeLuycker (2006) suggested that the species’ altitudinal range may be restricted to below 1,000 m. The study undertaken by Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>(2009) registered the species between 252 and 1,053 metres asl. Results from research undertaken in the Proyecto Mono Tocón show that at least 60% of the species’ original habitat has already been lost. </p>    <p>There is an urgent need for additional surveys of all potential habitats in San Martin, and larger tracts of forest. Mark (2003) notes that subpopulations near the banks of the Rio Mayo differ in colour from those in the Aguaruna territory in the north-east. DeLuycker (2006) reported a marked difference in pelage colour between a group she studied in a fragment near Moyobamba and those photographed by Noel Rowe. During surveys, attention should be given to the distributions of the different colour morphs (Mark 2003). Bóveda-Penalba<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> (2009) detected little difference in colour in individuals of the Alto Mayo, they argue that pelage colour varies depending on the lighting conditions. Some darker animals appeared much lighter when their bodies were turned in a different direction, making it difficult to determine differences in colour between Alto Mayo populations and the same was true for the quantity of white hair on the face. However, animals in the southern part of San Martin appear to be somewhat greyer than animals near Alto Mayo and usually do not have a a white mask (Tello-Alvarado J. C. pers comm). Bóveda-Penalba <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2009) claim that the species lives in sympatry with another, undescribed species of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Callicebus</span> in the southern part of its range.

This species’ range may include the Bosque de Protección de Alto Mayo, which extends from the town of Rioja north along the border between the departments of San Martín and Amazonas, however more surveys are needed to confirm this as there species was registered once in a buffer zone of this protected area. During short surveys of the Reserve, no titis were detected in the high-altitude areas which make up most of the reserve. It is likely that the species only occurs in the low-altitude areas on the edges of the reserve (&lt;1%) (Rowe and Martinez 2003, DeLuycker 2006). Other protected areas in this species’ range include, Tarangue (74 ha), which belongs to a conservation organization called IKAMA Peru. The species also occurs in the Pabloyacu Reserve (640 ha) of the Universidad de San Martín, but despite its name this is not a protected area.</p>  <p>Mark (2003) and DeLuycker (2006) have emphasized the potential importance of both privately owned reserves and Amerindian reservations for the long-term conservation of this species. There are 14 indigenous Aguaruna communities located throughout the Alto Mayo region. The large tracts of forested land allocated to these well-organized communities could play a key role in conservation initiatives (Mark 2003). <br/> <br/> A team of scientists from NatureServe, Conservation Data Center - Peru/UNALM, and the Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonia Peruana (IIAP) have recently completed part of a a project financed by the Moore foundation “Endemic Species and Ecological Systems of the Eastern Andean Slope and the Amazon Basin in Peru and Bolivia”.

The species does not occur in any protected areas.","This taxon occurs in relatively dry forest patches within a forest-savanna mosaic, apparently restricted to gallery forest and immediately adjacent forest islands (Lonnberg 1939; Anderson 1997; Felton <em>et al.</em> 2006; Martinez and Wallace 2007).<br/><br/>Titis are frugivores, monogamous primates that generally live in small family groups. Three groups, each with two members, were encountered at Puerto Santa Cruz, to the north of the Rio Yacuma. Aggressive displays were directed towards the researchers. Martinez and Wallace (2007) and Lopez-Strauss (2007) details average group sizes of 2.7 and 2 individuals respectively.","There is some forest loss and habitat fragmentation within its range. Groups surveyed by Felton <em>et al.</em> (2006) occurred in fragments surrounded by cattle ranches. A farmer in Naranjal reported seeing groups crossing grassland gaps (300–400 m) between patches of forest (Felton <em>et al</em>. 2006) and this behaviour has since been confirmed (J. Martinez and Lopez pers. comm.). Uncontrolled grassland fires are also a major threat especially if they jump to forest patches (J. Martinez pers. comm.). Critically, the proposed major improvement to a regional road will exacerbate deforestation and is likely to increase hunting pressure (Felton <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>The disappearance of the species from the type locality - La Laguna - indicates that they may be threatened locally by hunting (Felton <em>et al</em>. 2006). They are used as bait for fishing and cat hunting and some are captured for pets. Apparently the presence of sympatric primates such as <em>Saimiri</em> may also be a threat to <em>C. olallae</em> (J. Martinez pers. comm.).","The species was formerly only known from the type locality (La Laguna, 5 km from Santa Rosa, [upper río] Beni, Bolivia, altitude about 200 m; Patterson 1992, Tarifa 1996; Anderson 1997). In 2002, Felton <em>et al.</em> (2006) conducted titi monkey surveys and interviewed local residents at four locations: Puerto Santa Cruz on the Río Yacuma; the type locality of La Laguna; Petaca; and Naranjal. Titis were relatively abundant in Naranjal, not encountered in Petaca (although local residents claim they occur there), and are no longer present in La Laguna (probably exterminated through hunting). Examination of holotypes indicates that groups encountered in Rio Yacuma were <em>C. olallae</em>, while two of three groups found in Naranjal were <em>Callicebus modestus</em> (the third appeared to combine characters from both species).<br/><br/>Lopez-Strauss (2007) estimated density for both <em>C. olallae</em> and <em>C. modestus</em>s using calling behavior and an adapted point-count methodology. <em>C. olallae</em> presented conservative density estimates of between 1.8 and 11.5 groups per km² (Lopez-Strauss 2007).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Bolivia with very restricted range estimated to be 400 km² (Martinez and Wallace 2007). Recent surveys have revealed that <em>C. olallae</em> is apparently confined to gallery forest and adjacent forest islands of the Yacuma River, with just one other locality in gallery forest of the Manique River (Martinez and Wallace 2007), both in south-western Beni Department. In contrast to the geographic distribution proposed by van Roosmalen <em>et al.</em> (2002), Felton <em>et al</em>. (2006) argue that the species only occurs to the east of the Río Beni.

A home range size of 10.7 to 12.3 km² and mean day range of approximately 1 km was reported for this species (Price and Piedade 2001a).","This species has a relatively small geographic range that coincides with the most densely populated region of Brazil, which has the longest history of European colonization. This has resulted in widespread deforestation and fragmentation, with very little remaining forest cover (estimated from between 5 to 10%). The reduction of available habitat for the eastern Brazilian titis is ongoing, mainly due to pressures for cattle ranching and agriculture. These economic activities, together with urbanization, are driven by the developmental goals of local governments. The resulting small, isolated populations of titis are exposed to demographic and genetic risks, although hunting pressure is probably negligible to moderate in most cases, given their small body size. Titis are also rarely kept as pets, in comparison with the larger-bodied capuchins (<em>Cebus</em> spp.) and the much smaller marmosets (<em>Callithrix</em> spp.) from the same region.",Chiarello and Melo (2001) report a mean density of 15.67 ± 6.51 (±SE) individuals/km².,Decreasing,"This species occurs in the Atlantic forest of south-eastern Brazil in the state of Espírito Santo, north-western Minas Gerais and northern Rio de Janeiro (Kinzey 1982; M.

The isolation of populations due to habitat fragmentation taking place for agricultural development (rice paddies, maize) also threatens the genetic viability of small populations in Viet Nam (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). In Guangxi province, China, the threat of hunting is extremely severe, due to the illegal production of “black ape wine,” which is made specifically from this species; the animals are even imported illegally from Viet Nam for this purpose.

Almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A2c.,"An inhabitant of the Atlantic forest, occurring in both mature rain forest and disturbed fragments. The ecology of this species is relatively unknown, with most data coming from inferences based on studies of other members in the genus, which suggest that this species is frugivorous, monogamous, lives in small family groups (2 to 5 individuals) and is territorial (Cäsar <em>et al.</em> in press). A considerable amount of time is spent of foraging and feeding (47%), and a significant amount of time resting (21%) (Franco 2006).","This species inhabits the most developed and populous region of Brazil, and has suffered extensive habitat loss and fragmentation. Although the species is widespread, urbanization, expanding agriculture and logging practices have led to extreme fragmentation of the forests within its range and resulting small isolated populations. In many places, they have been locally or regionally extirpated even where forests patches remain.","The population density of <em>C. nigrifrons</em> in a 50-ha forest fragment was estimated at 80–100 individuals per km² (Soares 2006), which is six times higher than for <em>C. personatus</em> (a similar-sized species living in the same habitat).

Tovar (1992) observed <em>S. n. hernandezi</em> on the south bank of the Río Guayabero in highly seasonal dry forest and spiny-leaved scleromophic scub (<em>arrabal</em>). In Ecuador, Tirira (2007) describes the habitat of <em>S. n. graellsi</em> as tropical and subtropical humid forests between 200 and 1,300 m above sea level, although most commonly found below 400 m above sea level. <br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects) (Izawa, 1978). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet. The dentition of the tamarins (<em>Saguinus</em> and <em>Leontopithecus</em>) does not provide for gouging and they eat gums only when readily available. <br/><br/>Tamarins live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals, but usually 2-8. Tovar (1994) studied a group which ranged in size from 7 to 11. Eight groups of <em>S. n. graellsi</em> observed by de la Torre <em>et al.</em> (1992, 1995a) ranged in size from 2-9. Ten groups of <em>S. n. hernandezi</em> observed by Izawa (1978) averaged 6.3 individuals. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. One <em>Saguinus n. graellsi</em> group of 7-9 was found to use a home range of 56.2 ha in the dry season and 41.7 ha in the wet season (De la Torre <em>et al</em>. 1995a). <br/><br/>Size:<br/>Tamarins are monomorphic - exhibiting only minor differences in body and canine size.<br/>Adult males weigh 468 g (n=8) (Hershkovitz 1977; Hernández-Camacho and Defler 1985; Defler 2004)<br/>Adult females weigh 484 g (n=6) (Hershkovitz 1977; Hernández-Camacho and Defler 1985; Defler 2004)<br/>Adult males and females 390-470 g (Tirira 2007)<br/><br/><em>Saguinus nigricollis hernandezi</em><br/>Adult female holotype H&B 22.0, TL 34.0 cm (Hershkovitz, 1977).","<em>Saguinus n. nigricollis</em> is regarded as common in Peru by Soini <em>et al.</em> (1989), and although it was heavily exploited for export for biomedical research in the 1960/1970s, it was reported by Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) to be common in Colombia too. Its status in Brazil is unknown. <br/><br/><em>Saguinus n. graellsi</em> in Ecuador remains widespread north of the Río Napo, but its distribution overlaps a region that is experiencing high rates of forest loss.<br/> <br/><em>Saguinus n. hernandezi</em>, on the other hand, has a small distribution restricted to Colombia, but, although there is little information available regarding its conservation status, it occurs in the Tinigua National Park, is evidently adaptable, and there is no reason to believe that there are any major threats to its survival in the short term  (Hernández-Camacho and Defler 1985; Defler 1994).","Izawa (1978) calculated an ecological density for <em>S. n. hernandezi</em> on the Río Peneya, Colombia, of 1-24 individuals/km², and a crude density of 10-13 individuals/km².<br/><br/>Population density estimated for <em>S. n. graellsi</em> in the Cuyabeno Faunal Production Reserve, Ecuador, by De la Torre <em>et al</em>. (1995a) was 22-33 individuals/km². Delfer (2004) recorded crude denties at four sites aloing the upper Río Purité, Colombia, that ranged from 4-15 individuals/km².",Decreasing,"There are three recognized subspecies:<br/><br/><em>Saguinus nigricollis nigricollis</em><br/>Hershkovitz (1977) recorded that it occurs between the Rios Solimões-Amazonas and Içá-Putumayo, at least as far west as the mouth of the Río Napo. Aquino and Encarnación (1994) documented its occurrence west from there along the left (north) bank of the Río Napo in Peru, upstream at least as far as the Ríos Aguarico, Lagartococha and Güepi on the border with Ecuador, where it is replaced by <em>S. n. graellsi</em>, as was proposed by Hershkovitz (1982). In Colombia, its distribution is poorly known, but Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) and Defler (1994) reported that it occurs north of the Río Putumayo to the Río Caquetá, and east to the Brazilian border, indicating its, as yet undocumented, presence between the Rios Japurá and Iça in Brazil (Hershkovitz 1977, 1982). However, evidence for its occurrence north of the Río Putumayo in Colombia is sparse. Its supposed presence in two large protected areas in this region (La Paya National Natural Park and Cahuinarí National Natural Park) has not yet been confirmed (Defler 1994). Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) reported that they observed <em>S. n. nigricollis</em> groups mixed with <em>S. f. fuscus</em> at Puerto Leguízamo, located on the north bank of the upper Putumayo. According to them <em>S. n. graellsi</em> is sympatric with <em>S. n. nigricollis</em> at Puerto Leguízamo, and west from there between the Ríos Putumayo and Caquetá. For this reason, they argued that the form <em>graellsi</em> should be considered a distinct species (see also Defler 1994). Otherwise the only evidence is that of a young specimen collected in 1960 by H. Granados and H. Arévalo labeled “Caquetá-Putumayo”, as reported by Hershkovitz (1982) who pointed out that it may have been taken from the left bank of the Río Putumayo. Hershkovitz (1982) argued that the evidence for the occurrence of <em>S. n. nigricollis</em> north of the Río Putumayo is not yet conclusive. In this case, the possibility remains that its range is restricted to the right bank of the Río Putumayo. This being so, Hershkovitz (1982) pointed out that there would be a gap between the ranges of <em>S. n. hernandezi</em> (north of the Río Caquetá) and <em>S. n. graellsi</em> (south of the Río Putumayo). Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976), however, give place <em>S. n. graellsi</em> as occurring north of the upper reaches of the Río Putumayo, north to the Río Caquetá, in which case the ranges would be continuous with <em>S. n. hernandezi</em> north of the Río Caquetá. The exact range of <em>S. n. nigricollis</em> in Colombia remains unclear. North of the Río Putumayo, <em>S. n. nigricollis</em> would be sympatric with <em>S. fuscicollis fuscus</em>.<br/><br/><em>Saguinus nigricollis graellsi</em><br/><em>Saguinus nigricollis graellsi</em> occurs in the upper Amazon, in southern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and north-eastern Peru. Its range is not well known, however, and our interpretation of the current evidence indicates that it is probably more restricted than is indicated by Hershkovitz (1977, 1982). According to Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976), in Colombia it occurs south from right (south) bank of the upper Río Caquetá to the Ríos Sucumbios and Putumayo on the border with Ecuador. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) recorded that it occurred in the neighborhood of Puerto Asís on the upper Putumayo, east as far as Puerto Leguízamo. These authors informed that <em>S. n. graellsi</em> is sympatric with <em>S. n. nigricollis</em> in the region of Puerto Leguízamo, and the form <em>graellsi</em> should, therefore, be considered a distinct species, although doubts remain. Defler (1989, 1994) argued for this possibility, although Hernández-Camacho and Defler (1988) listed it as a subspecies of <em>S. n. nigricollis</em>. Hershkovitz (1982) argued that there is no definite evidence for <em>S. n. graellsi</em> occurring north of Ecuador, and suggested that Black-mantle Tamarins reported by Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) may be either of the other two subspecies. He restricted its northern limit to the Ríos Putumayo and Sucumbios, indicating as such that it does not occur in Colombia at all. According to Hershkovitz (1982), in Ecuador <em>S. n. graellsi</em> extends throughout a large part of the Amazon region, south from the Río Putumayo, west to the foothills of the Andes. The altitudinal range is between 100 m and 1,000 m (Hershkovitz 1982). Hershkovitz (1977) suggested that the range in Ecuador may extend as far south as the right bank of the upper Río Santiago, although in a later publication (Hershkovitz 1982) he was more conservative, giving the north (right) bank of the Río Pastaza as the limit. The only specimens from the Ríos Pastaza and Tigre are from their uppermost reaches in Ecuador. <br/><br/>According to Aquino and Encarnación (1994), eastwards, <em>S. n. graellsi</em> extends into Peru along the right (south) banks of the Río Napo to its mouth, and restricted to the north (right) banks of the Ríos Amazonas and Marañón. However, <em>S. n. graellsi</em> has not been recorded in Peru except for the banks of the Napo and Curaray, and its occurrence in the basins of the northern tributaries of the Río Marañón has yet to be confirmed. Aquino and Encarnación (1994) reported that <em>S. n. graellsi</em> has never been found along the Rios Tigre and Pastaza, for example, despite a number of primatological surveys along these rivers between 1981 and 1986. The known distribution in Peru is restricted to the region between the Ríos Nanay and Napo. Although occurring north of the Río Napo in Ecuador, it extends east only as far the Ríos Güepí and Lagartococha on the frontier with Peru (Hershkovitz 1982), where it is replaced by <em>S. n. nigricollis</em> (Hershkovitz 1982; Aquino and Encarnación 1994). It has been recorded recently in a number of localities in northern Ecuador between the Ríos Napo and Putumayo, including the basins of the Río Aguarico, Cuyabeno and Pacuyacu (S. de la Torre, in litt. 1996). However, it has not been found in the Yasuní National Park, covering the basin of the Rio Yasuní, where it would seem that only <em>S. tripartitus</em> and <em>S. fuscicollis lagonotus</em> occur (Albuja 1994; S. de la Torre, in litt., 1996). Although Hershkovitz (1977) argued for the restriction of the type locality to the right bank of the Río Napo above the mouth of the Rio Curaray, no definite records or specimens are available for <em>S. n. graellsi</em> in Ecuador between these rivers (Hershkovitz 1977, 1982; Albuja 1994), and it would seem probable that only two <em>Saguinus</em> species occur there: <em>S. tripartitus</em> and <em>S. fuscicollis lagonotus</em>.<br/><br/>The distribution of <em>S. n. graellsi </em> therefore has yet to be clearly defined. However, if it occurs in Colombia it would be sympatric with <em>S. fuscicollis fuscus</em>, and in Ecuador and Peru it is sympatric, at least in some areas such as the upper reaches of the Rios Napo, Curaray, Pindo Yacu and Pastaza, with <em>S. fuscicollis lagonotus</em> (see Hershkovitz 1982; Aquino and Encarnación 1994). It would appear that it does not occur between the Ríos Curaray and Napo in Peru and Ecuador, and is not, therefore, sympatric with <em>S. tripartitus</em>. Tirira (2007) reported that the limjits of its range in Ecuador are poorly defined. In the north of the country, it is not known if it reaches the ríos Sucumbíos and Putumayo, and that the identity of the tamarins to the south of the Río Napo in the provinces of Oreallana and Pastaza is uncertain. <br/><br/><em>Saguinus nigricollis hernandezi</em><br/><em>Saguinus n. hernandezi</em> occurs in eastern Colombia between the Ríos Caquetá, Caguan, and Orteguaza and the base of the Cordillera Oriental, Intendencia de Caquetá (Hershkovitz 1982). K. Izawa (in Hershkovitz 1982) reported that <em>S. n. hernandezi</em> was not seen on the north bank of the Río Caquetá, but it has been found to the north and north-east of the Caquetá in the Department of Meta, Angostura I, on the right bank of the Río Guayabero (Hernández-Camacho and Defler 1988; Tovar 1994). Presumably it occurs at least along the eastern slopes of the Andes from the headwaters of the Río Caguan to the Río Guayabero.

Aquino and Encarnación (1994b) reviewed the habitat and forest preferences of the genus.<br/><br/>Night monkeys are nocturnal: they are most active at dawn and dusk. The only exception is <em>Aotus azarae azarae</em> of the Chaco of southern Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, which is cathemeral (active during night and day). They are frugivorous; their diet includes fruit, nectar and flowers, leaves, and small animals prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernandez-Duque 2007).<br/><br/>They are socially monogamous, living in small groups of an adult pair and offspring of different ages (infant, one or two juveniles and sometimes a subadult. In <em>A. a. azarae</em> a significant number of adults range alone. They may be subadults that have left their natal groups or older adults which have been evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernandez-Duque and Huntington 2002; Fernandez-Duque 2004). Both sexes disperse. Males care for the infants (carry them) (Rotundo <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2005). Lone adults were observed by Villavicencio Galindo (2003) in northern Colombia. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on the species and location) (Wright 1978, 1981; Fernandez-Duque 2007).

In the wild, male <em>A. azarae</em> reach adult weight only when about 4 years old, and age at first reproduction is about 5 years of age (Juárez <em>et al.</em> 2003; Fernandez-Duque 2004). Single offspring are the rule. Wright (1985) recorded births between August and February for <em>A. nigriceps</em> in Peru (Manu National Park), and Aquino <em>et al.</em> (1990) indicated a birth season between December and March for <em>A. nancymaae</em> in north-eastern Peru.<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Adult male weight average 0.889 kg (n=6), adult female weight 0.916 kg (n=11) (Crile and Quiring 1985).","Major threats to this species are largely unknown, although deforestation is known to be taking place in parts of its range.

However, as the area of occupancy is split into 70 separate fragments, over half of which are 100 ha or less, a more realistic estimate of total population is likely to be in the range of 500-1000 individuals.",Decreasing,"Kobayashi and Langguth (1999) believed the range of <em>Callicebus coimbrai</em> was limited to the coastal rainforests at the mouth of the rio São Francisco in Sergipe and the mouth of the rio Itapicuru in northern Bahia, Brazil.

Knowledge of this species’ range and conservation status has increased substantially in the recent years (Kobayashi and Langguth 1999; Sousa 2000, 2003; Printes 2005; Jerusalinsky <em>et al.</em> 2006; Sousa <em>et al</em>. in prep). The taxon has now been confirmed at at least 70 sites in the states of Bahia and Sergipe. The largest is a 3,000 ha tract in São Francisco do Paraguaçu, Bahia; the smallest is a 6 ha fragment in Nossa Senhora da Glória, Sergipe (Sousa 2003).

This trend is likely to continue into the next 30 years, and may be compounded by hunting.","Endemic to the fluvial plain of eastern Amazonia, where predominantly found at low altitudes in tall terra firme rain forests; it has also been observed in secondary forests and on rare occasions in mangroves (Silva Jr. 1991; Lopes 1993). Recent field studies (Ferrari <em>et al.</em> 1999b; Port-Carvalho and Ferrari 2002; Santo 2002; Silva 2003; Veiga 2006) have demonstrated that this taxon is able to survive and reproduce (in the absence of hunting), in fragments much smaller than previously thought possible. Small groups have been found in fragments and on islands of less than 20 ha, some of which have been isolated for over 20 years. They are relatively abundant in tracts of forest of between 100 and 1,000 ha, suggesting a degree of tolerance to anthropogenic habitat disturbance and behavioural flexibility in the face of change. Groups with 4 to 39 individuals have been recorded in fragmented habitats (Ferrari <em>et al</em>. 1999; Port-Carvalho and Ferrari 2002, 2004; Santos 2002; Silva 2003; Veiga 2006). <br/><br/>The species is a highly frugivorous and is a specialist seed predator: immature seeds can represent as much as 90% of their diet in certain months. Other important plant resources are fruit pulp and flowers. Small quantities of pith, shoots and young leaves are also eaten, as well as a range of arthropods including caterpillars, termites, ants and spiders (Veiga and Ferrari 2006). One means by which some groups coped with extreme fragmentation is by increasing the proportion of flowers and non-reproductive plant parts in the diet (Santos 2002; Silva 2003; Veiga 2006). The home range of a group (39 members) residing in a forest fragment (1,300 ha) over a period of 12 months was 98.6 ha (Veiga 2006). No studies have been undertaken in areas of continuous forest, but it is likely that groups would range over much larger areas, probably covering several hundred hectares; a group of <em>Chiropotes albinasus</em> was recorded using an area in excess of 1,000 ha over an 11-month period (Pinto 2008).","The greatest risks for the future survival of the Black Bearded Saki are the loss and fragmentation of its habitat and hunting pressure. It has the smallest range of the genus, which coincides with the most densely populated part of Brazilian Amazonia, a region with a long tradition of colonization, and which now has deforestation levels that begin to rival those of the Atlantic Forest. Over the last few decades, the establishment of highways, implantation of the Tucuruí hydroelectric dam, logging, and agricultural and ranching activities have lead to widespread devastation of forested areas in this region. The proliferation of secondary roads has further exacerbated this process. <em>Chiropotes satanas</em> is already locally extinct in a large part of its original range and what remains is extremely fragmented and under constant deforestation pressure. <br/><br/>Despite not being particularly lucrative or an easy target, this species is also hunted for its meat and fur. Habitat fragmentation processes are probably increasing hunting pressure on this species by providing easier access and through the loss of preferred game. Although this species is more tolerant of habitat fragmentation than previously thought, this should not be considered a motive for complacency with regard to the importance of the implementation of conservation measures, particularly the establishment and adequate control of protected areas. In addition, small populations living in isolated fragments with few opportunities for dispersal are probably not genetically viable in the long-term. There is an obvious need for some management of metapopulations.","From studies using standardized line transects, population densities and sightings/10 km, have been calculated for the a number of areas (see table 1). Density varies depending on the differing influences of hunting pressure and habitat disturbance, but appears to be greater in smaller fragments with lower levels of hunting pressure.",Decreasing,"Endemic to eastern Amazonia in Brazil, this species has a restricted range between the right bank of the rio Tocantins and the eastern limits of the Amazon forest in the Brazilian states of Pará and Maranhão. Although it resides in terra firme forests, its distribution extends as far as the coastal (mangrove) forests and forested areas in the transitional zone between Amazon Forest and Cerrado (savanna) at the southern and eastern borders of its distribution. The most southerly record is at -06 31' 59'' -47 27'00'' in Estreito, Maranhão State (Hershkovitz 1985; Silva Jr. 1991; Lopes 1993).",,Terrestrial,"It is listed on CITES Appendix II.<br/>The primary federal protected area within this region is the Gurupi Biological Reserve (REBIO Gurupi) in Maranhão State (original area 341,650 ha). Together with contiguous Amerindian reservations, it forms a nucleus of continuous forest covering an estimated one million hectares. Despite its potential importance for the conservation of <em>Chiropotes satanas</em> (and the threatened <em>Cebus kaapori</em>), this area suffers intense pressure from local ranchers, timber companies and illegal land settlers, and almost one-third of the Gurupi Reserve's forest has already been lost. <br/><br/>The following state protected areas occur within the range of this species, although their presence within all these areas has not been confirmed: Pará state - APA Lago de Tucuruí - margem direita (568,667 ha); Maranhão state - APA do Maracanã (18,131 ha), APA da Baixada Maranhense (1,775,035 ha), APA das Reentrâncias Maranhenses (2,680,911 ha), APA Upaon-Açu/Miritiba/Alto Preguiça (1,535,310).

ICM/CPB together with local has been working towards the resolution of some of the key problems in the REBIO Gurupi but a large-scale operation and continuous monitoring are required to ensure its effective protection. An international committee (Comitê Internacional para Conservação e Manejo dos Primatas Amazônicos) was established by the Chico Mendes Institute (ICM) in conjunction with the the CPB to discuss and define the conservation of Amazonian primate taxa, and together with members of the Pitheciine Action Group (PAG) are developing a Conservation Action Plan for the Black Bearded Saki. <br/><br/>Surveys are needed to identify remaining populations both in protected reserves and other areas. The CPB implemented ""Projeto Kaapori"" for the <em>Cebus kaapori</em> and have undertaken surveys and conducted interviews with local people in the central-north, north and west of Maranhão. They collected data on all primate species including <em>C. satanas</em>, which will be used in the development of the Action Plan. Given the current situation of the REBIO Gurupi and the lack of other federal protected areas, both privately owned reserves and Amerindian reservations are becoming increasingly important for the long-term conservation of <em>Chiropotes satanas</em> (Ferrari <em>et al</em>. 1999). Research on the effects of fragmentation on isolated populations is also key if we are to be able to evaluate the long-term chances of survival and manage the remaining populations.

During their primate surveys in the Noel Kempf Mercado National Park, Bolivia, Wallace <em>et al. </em>(1998) found <em>Alouatta sara</em> only (n=20) in <em>igapó</em> forest (seasonally inundated forest) along the Río Iteñez.<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are the large leaf-eaters of the South American primate communities. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. They spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting about quietly among the branches, fermenting leaves in their enlarged caecums. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaws which surround the enlarged larynx and hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber. It is with this enlarged and highly specialized voice box that they produce their howls (grunts, roars and barks). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 kms (Drubbel and Gautier 1993). The red howlers (<em>A. seniculus</em>, <em>A. macconnelli</em>, <em>A. juara</em>, <em>A. puruensis</em>, and <em>A. sara</em>) have the largest voice boxes and the deepest roars, while the Mexican, Central American and northern Colombian mantled howlers, <em>A. palliata</em> and <em>A. pigra</em>, have the smallest, and their howls are more high pitched as a result.<br/><br/>Red howler groups are usually small, ranging in size from 2-16 animals and averaging 4-10 (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988). Wallace <em>et al</em>. (1998) recorded an average group size of 3.3±2.0 individuals (range 1-7, n=18) in the Noel Kempff Mercado Nation Park in eastern central Bolivia. In the red howlers, there is usually only one dominant male in the group (occasionally two), others being sub-adults, or juveniles, along with a harem of two to five females. Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), the howler monkeys generally have quite small and broadly overlapping home ranges, of 5 ha up to 45 ha, depending on the type of habitat (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988).<br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria.<br/> <br/>Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days.

In recent years, this highway has become the main channel of colonization for soybean planters migrating northwards from Mato Grosso, although for the time being, this threat is limited to a relatively small proportion of the species’ range. Soybean farms contribute directly to forest clearing, but also provide the economic and political impetus for the development of new roads and infrastructure projects which accelerate rates of deforestation by other actors (Fearnside 2007).

In areas where suitable habitat does not exist they in some cases be found in marginal habitat surrounded by pastures and urban areas (Cuarón 1991, 1997; Marsh, 1999, 2001, 2002). In Calakmul, Mexico and Tikal, Guatemala, they occur in semideciduous tropical forest, but in Yaxchilán in tall evergreen rain forest (Estrada <em>et al</em>. 2004). This species is mainly found in areas below 900 m, but more commonly below 400 m. However, Baumgarten and Williamson (2007) found them in locations up to 3,350 m asl. Reid (1997) reported that it is found in evergreen and semideciduous forest, remnant forest along rivers and tall second growth.<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are the large leaf-eaters of the South American primate communities. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. They spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting about quietly among the branches, fermenting leaves in their enlarged caecums. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaws which surround the enlarged larynx and hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber. It is with this enlarged and highly specialized voice box that they produce their howls (grunts, roars and barks). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 kms (Drubbel and Gautier 1993).<br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria. Silver <em>et al.</em> (1998, 2000) have studied the diet and feeding ecology of <em>A. pigra</em> in Belize.<br/><br/><em>Alouatta pigra</em> lives in smaller groups than <em>A. palliata</em>: 2-10 individuals per group compared with 2-45 for <em>A. palliata</em> (mean of 12.3) (Crockett and Eisenberg 1986; Chapman and Balcomb 1998; Pavelka and Chapman 2006). Estrada <em>et al</em>.

Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), the howler monkeys generally have quite small and broadly overlapping home ranges, of 5 ha up to 45 ha, depending on the type of habitat (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>Infant <em>Alouatta</em> are probably born throughout the year in Suriname, but data are not yet sufficient to determine if there is a birth peak. In Suriname, newborn infants have been seen in March, April, and November, and January (Mittermeier 1977). Crockett and Rudran (1987a,b) examined seasonal variation in births in red howlers from northern Venezuela, and found that they were less frequent during the early wet season (weaning would occur at the time of greatest food shortage). The llanos forests are more seasonal, however, than in the Guianas, and it is possible that this is not the case elsewhere. Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days. Interbirth intervals are generally about 16.6 months, although they may be shortened by the death of an infant to about 10.5 months (Crockett and Sekulic 1984).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Adult male weight 11.1-11.6 kg (mean 11.35 kg, n=2), adult female weight 6.3-6.6 kg (mean 6.4 kg, n=4) (Ford and Davis 1992)<br/>Adult male weight 11.4 kg (n=2) (Peres 1994)<br/>Adult female weight 6.43 kg (n=4) (Peres 1994).","The main threats to this species are deforestation, hunting (for food and for capture as pets) and disease (yellow fever epidemics) (Reid 1997; Pavelka and Chapman 2006).","<em>Alouatta pigra</em> is locally common across its range, but mainly in protected areas.

Smith (1970) identified the southern limits to its range in the east with three localities along the Río Motagua basin in Guatemala, including Quirigua and Zacapa (right bank of the river).

He noted large numbers of <em>A. pigra</em> in the Río Polochic delta, entering the west end of the Lago de Izabal. These are just to the north of the Río Motagua, where Curdts (1993) identified <em>A. palliata</em>. Baumgarten and Williamson (2007) found <em>A. pigra</em> in the northern margin of Rio Dulce and Lago Izabal, and to the West of Lago Izabal. This marks the southernmost locality for <em>A. pigra</em> in the Sierra de las Minas. <br/><br/>Baumgarten and Williamson (2007) provide the most recent review of the limits of the distributions of <em>Alouatta palliata</em> and <em>A. pigra</em> in Central America and Mexico. They found that the highland massif of northern Central America (including the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and central highland of Guatemala) and its associated coniferous and subalpine vegetation forms a geographic barrier separating <em>A. pigra</em> from <em>A. palliata</em>, and defines the southern limit of <em>A. pigra</em>. They discussed the two contact zones between them: the broad range of overlap north of the highland massif in Mexico over the lowlands of the states of Tabasco and Campeche, and a narrow area of contiguous, non-overlapping ranges in eastern Guatemala where the highlands extend almost the Caribbean. In the first, the localities where parapatry has been observed include Macuspana, Tabasco (Smith 1970; Horwich and Johnson 1986), around Zapata, Tabasco (Horwich and Johnson 1986) and the northern point of the Laguna de Términos in Campeche (Serio-Silva <em>et al.</em> 2006). There is no geographical barrier separating the species, both occur in the same forests and on both sides of the Rio Usamacinta, for example (Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In the second, the ranges are narrowly parapatric, separated by the Río Dulce and the Lago Izabal: <em>A. palliata</em> to the south and <em>A. pigra</em> to the north and west. South-west of Lake Izabal, <em>A. pigra</em> occurs in the highlands of the Sierra de las Minas, but not in the lowlands, occupied by <em>A. palliata</em>. Any past range overlap in this region will have been lost by the extensive oss of forest; the area is heavily farmed.  Baumgarten (2006) found no evidence to support sympatry supposed previously by Horwich and Johnson (1986), Curdts (1993) and Silva-López <em>et al.</em> (1998).<br/><br/>Serio-Silva <em>et al</em>.

They are frugivorous, but their diet includes also nectar, flowers (seasonally important for <em>A. a. azarae</em> in the Chaco), and small animal prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernández-Duque 2007). <em>Aotus azarae</em> has been observed to include a significant portion of leaves in its diet (Ganzhorn and Wright 1994; Wright 1985; Arditi and Placci 1990; Giménez and Fernández-Duque 2003).</p> <p>They are socially monogamous and form family groups of 2 to 5 individuals, comprising of an adult pair and 1 to 4 offspring of different age (infant, juveniles and sometimes a subadult). However, a significant number of adults are solitary. These may be subadults that left their natal groups or older adults which were evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernández-Duque and Huntington 2002; Fernández-Duque 2004). Normally, the male cares for the infants, but the females occasionally provide alimentation and care for the litter during the first week after the birth (Wright 1984; Dixson 1994).</p> <p>In the wild, male <em>A. azarae</em> reach adult weight when about 4 years old, and age at first reproduction is about 5 years (Juárez <em>et al.</em> 2003; Fernández-Duque 2004). Single offspring are the rule and the birth interval is 8 to 10 months (Wright 1985).</p> <p>Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on species and location) (Wright 1978; Fernández-Duque 2007). Wright (1989) points out that home ranges of <em>Aotus azarae azarae</em> could be bigger than those of <em>A. azarae boliviensis</em>. For instance, Wright (1989) gives 5 ha for Paraguay, but Schwindt <em>et al.</em> (2004) and (Arditi 1992) reported 4 to 10 ha in Argentina and 12 ha at Guaycolec, Formosa Province in Argentina, respectively.</p> <p> The intrinsic morphological similarities among species of the genus <em>Aotus</em> and the slight variation in their phenotypes make the identification of various subspecies difficult. However, differences in body coloration, geographic distribution and phylogenetic analysis need to be considered to finally establish the taxon’s’ taxonomic status and to obtain more information on its ecology and conservation status.</p>","<p> Threats to this species in the Brazilian Cerrado, in the Bolivian Chaco-Chiquitano forest, and the Paraguayan Chaco include habitat loss due to agricultural development for soy beans and cattle ranching. In Argentina it also includes small-scale farming and cattle ranching, and in Bolivia urban development around Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Minimal subsistence hunting occurs in Bolivia, for consumption and as bait for fishing. In Brazil, the main threats identified for the taxon were fire, agriculture, livestock keeping, urban expansion, deforestation, habitat disconnection, habitat reduction and mineral extraction. These are general threats for the taxon across its geographic range and there is no specific information available about the intensity of these threats affecting single populations (Rímoli and Rylands 2015).</p>","<p> Population density estimates for this species vary across different studies. Estimates are mainly available from Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Across its range, the species is relatively common, but due to its nocturnal and crepuscular behavior it is usually ignored in primate abundance surveys. Only a few reliable estimates of population density are available for any of the subspecies. Aquino and Encarnación (1994) reviewed population structure and densities for the genus.  </p> <p> In the eastern Formosa Province (Guaycolec) in Argentina, densities in gallery forests can be as high as 60 individuals/km² (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2001). Elsewhere in the Formosa Province, relatively lower densities were established: 32.3 individuals/km² (Zunino <em>et al.</em> 1986), 25.0 individuals/km²&#160;(Arditi and Placci 1990), 64.0 individuals/km²&#160;in gallery forests (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2001), 12.8-29 individuals/km²&#160;(Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2007), 15.0 individuals/km²&#160;(Brown and Zunino 1994), and 29.0 individuals/km²&#160;(Rathbun and Gache 1980).</p> <p>In Teniente Enciso in Paraguay, Stallings <em>et al.</em> (1989) estimated population density as 8.9 individuals/km², while for Agua Dulce, Stallings <em>et al.</em> (1989) reported 14.4 individuals/km².</p> <p>In Bolivia, Ayala (2011) reported 15.3-26.6 individuals/km² along the Rio Parapeti in the Bañados de Izozog depression (Ayala 2011). From the Bosque Chimanes, in Beni, 13-18 individuals/km²&#160;were reported (Rumiz and Herrera 2000) and Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated popualtion density to range from 0.8-7.4 individuals/10 km² in the Reserva de Vida Silvestre Ríos Blanco y Negro.</p>",Decreasing,"<p> The taxon is not endemic to Brazil, but occurs in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008). In Brazil it is present in the Pantanal of the states of states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, where it is resident and native (Cáceres <em>et al.</em> 2008; Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008; Melo and Damasceno Jr. 1998; Melo and Amorim 2003; Melo and Antunes 2004; Melo <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004; Melo and Martins Vincensi 2004; Tomas and Mourão 2007; Tomas <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011).  </p> <p>In Paraguay, Azara’s night monkeys are found in the dry southern and western parts of the Chaco (excluding the extreme West where no Primates occur) and west of the Paraguay River (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008). Its presence extends further to the South-west of the Rio Paraguay and across the Rio Pilcomayo in Bolivia and Argentina, and to the South of the Rio Bermejo and Rio Negro in the Argentinian provinces of Formosa and Chaco (Rathbun and Gache 1980, Hershkovitz 1983, Stallings 1985, 1989; Zunino <em>et al.</em> 1986; Stallings <em>et al.</em> 1989). In the West, its distribution extends along the Cordillera Oriental, but the limit to the North is not clearly defined (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008). According to Hershkovitz (1983), the species can occur in Bolivia’s Bañados de Izozog.</p> <p>Presumably, the current distribution is reduced relative to its historical extent. It is suspected that Azara’s night monkeys also occurred in southwestern Mato Grosso, in northwestern Mato Grosso do Sul (Corumbá and Ladário Municipalities) and along the border between Brazil and Bolivia (Tomas &amp; Mourão 2007, Tomas <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011 ).</p>",Common in local pet trade,Terrestrial,"<p> This species is listed in the appendix II of CITES.

This species has also been observed in white-sand forest, bamboo forest and ridge top forests (Shanee 2014). Home range sizes for this species vary between 92 and 174 ha with average daily path lengths between 1.03 and 1.2 km, both ranges and path lengths vary between seasons (Shanee 2014).<br/><br/>Sizes of multi-male/multi-female groups range from 5 to 22 individuals (Leo Luna 1989; Shanee and Shanee 2011, 2015) with average composition of 2.7 (min 1, max 7) adult males, 3.5 (min 1, max 9) adult females, 3.2 (min 1, max 7) juveniles, and 2.1 infants (min 1, max 5) (Shanee and Shanee 2015). Lone individuals of both sexes have also been observed (Shanee and Shanee 2011, 2015).&#160;<em>Lagothrix flavicauda</em> eats a variety of fruits, flowers, leaves, lichens, leaf bases of bromeliads, epiphyte roots and bulbs, and possibly insects (Leo Luna 1982, DeLuycker 2007, Shanee and Shanee 2011, Shanee 2014). At La Esperanza the diet of two groups of <em>L. flavicauda</em> consisted of fruit (46.3%), leaves (23.3%), insects (19.1%), mosses (6.6%), buds (2.8%) and flowers (1.8%) (Shanee 2014). The most commonly consumed arboreal food sources were <em>Cercropia montana</em>, <em>C. utcubamba</em>, <em>Hyeronima andina</em>, <em>Ficus eximia</em>, <em>Ficus</em> spp. <em>Ocotea dasyflora</em>, <em>Erythrina edulis</em>, <em>Styloceras laurifolium</em>, <em>Podocarpus oleifolius</em>, <em>Croton lechleri</em>,<em> Chrysophyllum venezuelanense</em>, <em>Clausia</em> sp. and <em>Allophylus</em> sp. (Shanee 2014). <em>Lagothrix flavicauda</em> modify their diets according to resource availability between the wet and dry seasons, consuming more leaves and insects when fruits are scarce (Shanee 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Size: <br/></strong>About 10 kg (Leo Luna 1984).","Relative inaccessibility of this species’ cloud forest habitat served as protection for <em>Lagothrix flavicauda</em> up until the 1950s (Leo Luna 1987, 1989). Subsequently, road construction, selective logging and subsistence hunting have led to deforestation, forest fragmentation and population declines (Aquino and Encarnación 1994, Butchart <em>et al</em>. 1995, DeLuycker 2007, DeLuycker and Heymann 2007, Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2007, Shanee 2011). More recently, mining operations have increased in this high mountain region. Leo Luna (1984) estimated 11,240 km² of remaining suitable forest habitat for this species in 1981. Buckingham and Shanee (2008) estimated 6,302 km² remaining in 2008, representing a prior average annual forest loss of over 180 km², and noted that 70% of the remaining forest habitat was unprotected. Peruvian ministry reports and GCF data suggest a slightly higher annual forest loss rate (210 km²/year) for San Martin Province, the core of this species range, over the period 2010-2017. These data would seem to suggest that the loss of nearly all remaining unprotected habitat within this species’ range is possible if current rates of deforestation continue to the year 2030.<br/><br/>In addition,<em> L. flavicauda</em> is heavily hunted by indigenous communities, market hunters and in retaliation for crop damage. Infants are also routinely taken as pets when mothers are killed (DeLuycker and Heymann 2007, Shanee 2012).","Estimates of current population size for this species vary widely with the best estimates between approximately 1,000 and 10,000 individuals (Mittermeier and Rylands 2013, Shanee and Shanee 2014). This species lives at fairly low population densities of 0.25-1 group per km²&#160;in Rio Abiseo National Park (Leo Luna 1987), 0.93-1.28 groups per km²&#160;at La Esperanza, Amazonas department (Shanee and Shanee 2011, 2015) and 0.93-2.24 groups per km² in the Abra Patricia-Alto Nieva Private Conservation Area (Cornejo 2007).",Decreasing,"The Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey is endemic to the montane rain forests and cloud forests of the Departments of San Martín (eastern part) and Amazonas (south western part) in the Peruvian Andes, south and east of the Río Marañón, at altitudes of 1,100 to 2,700 asl (Shanee 2011, Pitman <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Allgas <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). This species also occurs in smaller areas of La Libertad, Huánuco and Loreto (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 1975; 1977; Graves and O'Neil 1980; Leo Luna 1980, 1982, 1989; Parker and Barkley 1981; Shanee 2011; Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2014). Its distribution is limited in the north and northwest of Amazonas by the Maranon River valley, to the northeast by the lowlands of Loreto on the border with San Martin, in the east by the Huallaga River Valley. It extends south to either the Santa Martha or Magdalena river valleys in Huánuco. To the southwest and west in Huánuco, La Libertad, and San Martin this species is limited by the high cordillera to the east of the Maranon River. This limit continues north along this line to the start of the Utcubamba River in Amazonas, where it continues until joining with the Maranon River again in the northwest of Amazonas east of the Cordillera Colan.

17924308,41545,Alouatta caraya,Near Threatened,A4cde,2020,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Despite its large range, occurrence in numerous nature reserves in several countries, and apparent adaptation to modified habitats, <em>Alouatta caraya</em> is considered Near Threatened due to a suspected population reduction of 25-30% over 36 years (three generations; 2004-2040) due to ongoing loss of suitable habitat, hunting pressure, and the susceptibility of this species to disease outbreaks (e.g. yellow fever).","<em>Alouatta caraya</em> is found in deciduous, seasonally deciduous, mixed evergreen, gallery, and xeric forests, as well as in forest patches in savanna habitats. Today, it occupies forest patches throughout a large part of the Cerrado of central Brazil, and the Pantanal of Mato Grosso. It occupies deciduous forest (<em>caatinga alta</em>) in some areas in southern Piaui, western Bahia and north-western Minas Gerais. In Rio Grande do Sul occurs in mixed evergreen forest (<em>Araucaria</em>), forest patches in savanna, seasonal deciduous forest (Codenotti <em>et al. </em>2002; Codenotti and Silva 2004) and gallery forest. In Argentina, it specializes in semi-dry deciduous forests and gallery forests as well as the typical island forests of the Chaco (Arditi and Placci 1990; Brown and Zunino 1994). In Bolivia, it is found in the Chaco and Chiquitano forests, and gallery forest and forest islands in the Beni. In Paraguay, Stallings (1985; Stallings <em>et al.</em> 1989) reported that <em>A. caraya</em> occurs throughout the eastern forests and gallery forests of the southern and western Chaco along the ríos Paraguai and Pilcomayo, and the numerous small rivers that drain the Chacoan plain. It can also be found in sporadic xeric forests, continuous with gallery forests.<br/><br/>Mean adult male weight ranges from 6.42 kg (n=58, Rumiz 1990) to 7.77 kg (n=9, Svoboda <em>et al.</em> 2006), while mean adult female weight ranges from 4.33 kg (n=117, Rumiz 1990) to 5.13 kg (n=12, Svoboda <em>et al.</em> 2006). Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaw that surrounds the hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber, and enlarged larynx that produces their howls (grunts, roars and barks) (Kitchen <em>et al.</em> 2015). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 km (Drubbel and Gautier 1993; Cunha and Byrne 2006).<br/><br/>Howler monkeys have a folivorous-frugivorous diet (Crockett and Eisenberg 1987). The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. Although they regularly include mature leaves in their diet, softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Howlers spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting in the canopy, while their enlarged caeca ferment the leaves. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems, twigs and bark. A few groups inhabiting orchards near human habitations were reported to eat bird eggs (Bicca-Marques <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Behavioral and ecological field studies have been carried out mostly in Argentina and Brazil (see reviews by Bicca-Marques 2003, Oklander <em>et al.</em> 2011, Arroyo-Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> 2015, Cristóbal-Azkarate<em> et al.</em> 2015, Dias and Rangel-Negrín 2015, Fortes <em>et al.</em> 2015, Martínez-Mota <em>et al.</em> 2015).","<em>Alouatta caraya</em> is threatened by habitat loss due to agricultural development and cattle ranching in the Brazilian cerrado, soya farming in the Bolivian Chiquitano, and small-scale farms and cattle ranching in Argentina. Studies in Brazilian Amazonia suggest a loss of suitable forest habitat approaching 40% by the year 2050 if current conditions remain unchanged (Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; Subsistence hunting also occurs throughout much of this species' range.&#160; In studies of hunting impact in Amazonia, Peres and Palacios (2007) have shown that large-bodied primates such as <em>Alouatta</em> species may experience declines in population density upwards of 50% in areas of moderate to heavy hunting. In addition, significant population declines have been reported following outbreaks of sylvatic yellow fever in Brazil (Veiga <em>et al.</em> 2009; Bicca-Marques and Freitas 2010, Almeida <em>et al</em>. 2012, Freitas and Bicca-Marques 2013, Silva <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Argentina (Holzmann<em> et al.</em> 2010).","Although widespread, <em>Alouatta caraya</em> is patchily distributed, and densities vary widely. In Argentina, Brown and Zunino (1994) recorded high densities in a number of sites: Chaco forest, Formosa, 111 individuals/km²; Chaco forest, Corrientes, 90 individuals/km²; gallery forest, 63 individuals/km²; and inundated forest 283 individuals/km². Arditi and Placci (1990) carried out surveys in gallery forests of the Chaco in Argentina (Riacho Pilagá, Estancia Guaycolec) and found lower numbers than those reported by Brown and Zunino (1994) resulting from surveys in the 1980s: 11.7 individuals/km². Dvoskin <em>et al. </em>(2004) repeated the surveys there in 2001 and found that numbers had increased to 26 individuals/km².&#160; The highest densities (88–425 individuals/km²) occur in flooded forests and there have been numerous surveys of Alouatta caraya in this forest type of Argentina (Pope 1968; Rumiz 1990; Thorington Jr <em>et al.</em> 1994; Zunino <em>et al. </em>1996, 2001; Kowalewski and Zunino 2004). In the dry Bolivian Chaco, in the gallery forest of the Parapeti river, it was found at 15-18 individuals/km² (Ayala 2011). Codenotti <em>et al.</em> (2002; see also Codenotti and Silva 2004) located small and isolated populations, composed mostly of single groups, in forest fragments of up to 50 ha in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Densities in these small fragments ranged from 17 to 650 individuals/km². Similarly, Silva and Codenotti (2007) found densities ranging from 30 to 500 individuals/km² in small fragments in the municipality of Tupanciretã, Rio Grande do Sul. In the state of Paraná, Brazil, Aguiar<em> et al. </em>(2011) found densities of 40 to 260 individuals/km².<br/><br/>Overall, it is suspected that the population will suffer a reduction of 25-30% over 36 years (three generations; 2004-2040) due to loss of suitable habitat, subsistence hunting and population extirpations caused by disease (e.g. yellow fever).",Decreasing,"This is a wide-ranging species occurring throughout most of central-western Brazil (with range expanses to the north, northeast and south; Ludwig <em>et al.</em> in press), eastern Bolivia (Wallace <em>et al. </em>2013), eastern Paraguay (Stallings 1985), northeastern Argentina (Brown and Zunino 1994) and potentially reaching northwestern Uruguay (Villalba <em>et al.</em> 1995). It inhabits moist semi-deciduous, deciduous or higher altitude habitats within the Cerrado, Caatinga, Chaco, Pantanal, Pampa and Atlantic Forest biomes, mostly in gallery or floodplain forests and marginally in more humid forests of the Amazon.<br/><br/>The range of <em>Alouatta caraya</em> partly overlaps that of other howler species. It occurs in sympatry with <em>A. guariba</em> <em>clamitans</em> in the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul in south Brazil (Aguiar <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2014; Bicca-Marques <em>et al. </em>2008) and the Province of Misiones in Argentina (Agostini <em>et al.</em> 2008). Hybridization is suspected in these contact zones. In the state of Rondônia, Brazil, the species occurs in sympatry with <em>A. puruensis</em> (Alves 2006, 2013). Alencar and Melo (2013) report a potential contact zone with <em>A. belzebul</em> in the state of Tocantins, Brazil.

Loss of suitable habitat, which is likely to approach 40% by 2040 throughout the core of its  range if current conditions do not change, ongoing hunting pressure, and the susceptibility of this species to disease outbreaks (e.g. yellow  fever) is likely to cause the population to decline by more than 50% over 37 years (three generations; 2003-2040).</p>","<em>Alouatta discolor</em> is found in lowland terra firma and seasonally inundated rain forest (igapó), palm swamps, and secondary forest (Pinto 2002, Pinto and Setz 2004). Although relatively common in much of its geographical distribution, it can be rare in some areas. In a preliminary survey conducted in Jamanxim National Park, <em>A. discolor</em> was the most frequent species (Buss <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the region of Tapajós National Forest, along the BR-163 highway, Spix's howlers are more abundant in forest fragments in relation to continuous forest (Ferrari<em> et al. </em>2003). However, the species is rare further south to the Serra do Cachimbo, between the BR-163 and the Tapajós River.<br/><br/>Howler monkeys are the most folivorous of the New World primates. The contribution of leaves to the diet of Howlers varies across their geographical distribution, depending on characteristics of habitat and fluctuations in food availability (Rylands and Mittermeier 2013). Compared with the diets of the other Howlers, <em>A. discolor</em> has one of the highest rates of frugivory (Pinto 2002; Pinto and Setz 2004). For a group studied for one year in Paranaita, Rio Santa Helena, ripe fruits made up most of the diet in all months but one. The annual diet was 55% ripe fruit and some unripe fruit (0.6%), 19.8% young leaves, 5.7% flowers, 5% mature leaves, 4.4% bark, 3.2% decaying wood, 0.5% soil from termitaria, and small amounts of twigs, petioles, and orchid pseudobulbs (Pinto 2002; Pinto and Setz 2004). <br/><br/><em>Alouatta discolor</em> lives in unimale-multifemale or multimale-multifemale groups, with 2–9 individuals. In the study in Paranaita, home range of a group with 7–9 individuals was 69 ha (Pinto 2002; Pinto and Setz 2004). Seasonal migration from terra firma to igapó was observed in the flood season, during the peak fruiting in the igapó (Pinto 2002).<br/><br/>Adult male weight is 6.5–8.0 kg; adult female weight is 4.8–6.2 kg (Glander and Pinto 2013).","<em></em>The main threats to <em>Alouatta discolor</em> include deforestation driven by logging, agriculture (mainly soybean expansion), cattle ranching, mining, expanding rural settlements, and energy and transportation matrix development (i.e., paving of the Cuiabá-Santarém highway (BR-163), which bisects its range north to south, and the Transamazon highway (BR-230), which bisects its range west to east), as well as limited subsistence hunting. Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. (2006) project that close to 100 mammal species in Brazilian Amazonia will lose more than 40% of their tropical forest habitat within protected areas and as much as 80% outside of those areas by the year 2050 due to the expansion of cattle and soy industries, and the construction of all-weather highways into the region’s core.&#160; This projection is based upon assumptions that the current rates of deforestation and highway construction will continue, compliance with legislation requiring forest reserves on private land will remain low, and new protected areas will not be created. According to Azevedo-Ramos <em>et al.</em> (2006), approximately 60% of Amazonian primate ranges fall outside of protected areas.&#160; Construction plans for the Tapajós Hydroelectric Complex (Ravetta 2008, Buss <em>et al</em>. 2017) include a number of dams within the range of <em>Alouatta discolor</em>, including two along the Jamanxin River that are projected to flood an estimated 65,000 hectares of tropical forest habitat within four protected areas in which this species presently occurs: Jamanxin National Park, Itaituba I National Forest, Itaituba II National Forest, and the Tapajos Environmental Protection Area (Fearnside 2015). Based on surveys (1987-2005) of more than 100 sites, in areas where Amazonian howler monkeys are subjected to medium levels of hunting, population densities are reported to have declined by as much as 50% (Peres and Palacios 2007).

In average mantled howlers spend 21% of their time feeding (range 8–40 %, Dias and Negrin 2015). They mainly consume fruits and leaves, but the relative proportions vary by study site, with some populations being mostly folivorous while others have a more equal share of fruits and leaves in their diets. Other food items include flowers, petioles, buds, etc. (see Dias and Negrin 2015 for a detailed review of howler diets).<br/><br/>Group size varies considerably, with some locations reporting sizes of 40 or more individuals in a single group (in Mexico and Costa Rica), although the average group size is 15.2 individuals (Dias and Negrin 2015).

In Costa Rica, population densities between 4.9 and 30 ind./km²&#160;have been estimated for <em>A. p. palliata</em> (see Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2011) and 0.2 and 0.1 groups/km² were reported in protected areas (see Glander 2013). In Nicaragua this subspecies is known to occur in densities of 0.21 individuals/ha in fragmented habitats (Williams-Guillen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Densities above 90 ind./km²&#160;are reported for <em>A. p. palliata</em> and <em>A. p. aequatorialis</em> in Panama (Chiriqui 1,050, Baldwin and Baldwin 1972, 1976; and BCI 91.7, Milton 1982, respectively). In Colombia, Ramírez-Orjuela and Sánchez-Dueñas (2005) estimated between 0.7 and 1.5 ind./km² for <em>A. p. aequatorialis</em>, but Glander (2013) comments that there are reports of 20 ind./km² in the same general region in Colombia. Population density of <em>A. p. trabeata</em> in the Azuero Peninsula shows great variability, with some areas holding up to 42 ind./km², whereas other areas having as low as 0.5 ind./km² (Average 5.2 ind./km², Méndez-Carvajal 2013). The density of the Coiba Island howler (<em>A. p. coibensis</em>) was estimated to an average of 4.1 groups/km² (17.6 ind/km²) and a total population of 472 individuals (Mendez-Carvajal 2012).<br/><br/>A population reduction of 30% or more is inferred over the course of three generations. This is based upon Global Forest Watch data (Global Forest Watch 2020) for southeastern Mexico south through Central America, into western Colombia and Ecuador, and extreme northern Peru. The data suggests that, should forest loss continue at the same rate that has been seen since 2003, close to 30% of this species’ suitable habitat is likely to be lost by the year 2048. In addition, the species is threatened by hunting.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Alouatta palliata</em> is distributed from the southern portion of the state of Veracruz in Mexico, and extends south through the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Chiapas and Tabasco, throughout Central America and the Pacific Coast and western slopes of the Andes in Colombia and Ecuador, reaching the Tumbes region in northern Peru.<br/><br/>There are five recognized subspecies:<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata palliata</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>This subspecies is distributed from southern Guatemala to western Panama. However, the limits separating <em>A. p. palliata</em> from<em> A. p. aequatorialis</em> are not clear. Lawrence (1933) cited a specimen of <em>A. p. palliata</em> from Cotó, extreme western Panama, and Hill (1962, p.106) mentioned that specimens from Sevilla Island, western Panama, collected by J. H. Batty were “manifestly” <em>A. p. palliata</em>. Hall (1981), on the other hand, lists Sevilla Island, and Puerto Cortez, Costa Rica, as marginal records for <em>A. p. aequatorialis</em>. Lawrence (1933) comments that many individuals from Panama are intermediate. Based on mitochondrial DNA analyses, Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> (2003) reported two clades separating <em>A. p. palliata</em>/<em>A. p. coibensis</em>/ <em>A. p. mexicana</em> from <em>A. p. trabeata</em>/<em>A. p aequatorialis</em>, and mentioned that these two clades were divided around the Sona Peninsula in western Panama (Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2003). Consistent with this view, recent analyses of individuals from Limones in Punta Burica Panama (Cortés-Ortiz unpubl.) show that their mitochondrial DNA haplotypes cluster with those from <em>A. p. palliata</em> from Costa Rica. To the north, <em>A. p. palliata</em> extends through Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras reaching the south margin of Rio Dulce in southern Guatemala, where it may be sympatric with <em>A. pigra</em> (Curdts 1993, Baumgarten and Williamson 2007). It is not known to currently occur in El Salvador (Burt and Stirton 1961), but it is likely that it occurred there in the past (Daugherty 1972).<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata mexicana</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>The distribution of <em>A. p. mexicana</em> ranges from southern Veracruz state in Mexico extending southeast to northeastern Oaxaca (Ortiz-Martínez <em>et al.</em> 2008), western Tabasco, and northern Chiapas (see Serio-Silva <em>et al.</em> 2006). In Tabasco <em>A. p. mexicana</em> is sympatric with <em>A. pigra </em>(Smith 1970) and hybridization has been confirmed in that region (Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2015b). Serio-Silva <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported the presence of <em>A. p. mexicana</em> in Campeche, Mexico, based on the observation of individuals with atypical white hairs on the flanks of their bodies. Cortés-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> (in prep.) have analysed mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from individuals in Campeche with similar coloration patterns and concluded that they are <em>A. pigra</em>, and not <em>A. palliata</em> or hybrid individuals. The reason for the presence of white hairs in the pelage of <em>A. pigra</em> individuals remains unclear. Although several published maps include the range of this subspecies extending into the highlands of Chiapas and north-central Guatemala, a study by A. Cuarón (unpublished) revealed that its range is restricted to western Chiapas, central and western Tabasco, southern Veracruz, and northeastern Oaxaca. Baumgarten and Williamson (2007) argued that <em>A. palliata</em> could have occurred on the Pacific side of the highland massif of northern Central America. There are historical records that suggest the presence of <em>A. palliata</em> (putatively <em>A. p. mexicana</em>) in this region in Mexico (Estrada and Coates-Estrada 1984) and Guatemala (Handley 1950), but no current populations are reported.<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata aequatorialis<br/></strong>Alouatta palliata aequatorialis</em> occurs in eastern Panama extending through the Serranía del Darién (Anthony 1916, Lawrence 1933) to western Colombia, Ecuador and into the Tumbes region of northwestern Peru (Aquino and Encarnación 1994; Encarnación and Cook 1998; Tirira 2001, 2007). In northern Colombia <em>A. p. aequatorialis</em> is sympatric with <em>A. seniculus</em> in the left banks of the Peye and Atrato rivers in the department of Chocó and perhaps east of the Atrato River, south to the río Sinú (Zuñiga Leal and Defler 2013).<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata coibensis </strong></em><strong><br/></strong>This howler monkey is known only from Coiba Island and neighbouring Jicarón Island, off the Pacific coast of Panama (Milton and Mittermeier 1977, Méndez-Carvajal 2012).<em><br/><br/><strong>Alouatta palliata trabeata</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>This subspecies is endemic to the Azuero Peninsula, Panama (Froehlich and Froehlich 1987, Rowe 2000, Mendes-Carvajal 2005).</p>",This species is hunted for bushmeat and also live captured for the pet trade.

It is not restricted to primary habitats and presents tolerance to environmental changes and disturbances, being found in mining areas in Parà (Carvalho 2010) and occupying small size regenerating fragments in Atlantic Forest (Fialho <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are the large leaf-eaters of the South American primate communities. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaws which surround the enlarged larynx and hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber. It is with this enlarged and highly specialized voice box that they produce their howls (grunts, roars and barks). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 km (Drubbel and Gautier 1993).<br/><br/>They can usually be seen in groups numbering from four or five or up to 11 or so individuals. There is usually only one dominant male in the group (occasionally two), others being sub-adults, or juveniles, along with a harem of two to five females. Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), the howler monkeys generally have quite small and broadly overlapping home ranges, of 5 ha up to 45 ha, depending on the type of habitat (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988). Pina <em>et al.</em> (2002) studied two groups of 5-6 and 7-9 individuals (each with just one adult male and two adult females), in Caxiuanã (Pará), with home ranges of 13.5 ha and 18.05 ha, respectively. Bonvicino (1989), in Atlantic Forest (Pacatuba, Paraìba), recorded home ranges between 4.45 ha and 9.50 ha.<br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria. The diet of two <em>A. belzebul</em> groups in the Caxiuanã National Forest was studied by Souza <em>et al.</em> (2002). They were largely folivorous but would switch to fruits whenever available, especially during the wet season. <br/><br/><strong>Size:</strong><br/>Adult male: HB 44-68 cm, TL 54-74.5 cm (n=18); adult female: HB 30-64.5 cm; TL 45-70 cm (n=23) (Gregorin 1996)<br/>Adult male weight 4.7 kg (4.1-5.2) (n=8); adult female weight 3.2 kg (2.9-3.6) (n=6) (for Atlantic Forest individuals - CPB, unpublished data)<br/>Adult male weight 7.27 kg (n=27), adult female weight 5.52 kg (n=26) (Peres 1994)<br/>Adult male weight 6.5-8.0 kg (mean 7.3 kg, n=27), adult female weight 4.85-6.2 kg (mean 5.5 kg, n=26) (Ford and Davis 1992).","More than 95% of the <em>Alouatta belzebul</em> population is located in Brazilian Amazonia, versus the Atlantic Forest region. Amazonian forests are projected to be reduced by as much as 40% by the year 2050 due to illegal deforestation, hydroelectric projects, road-building, cattle-ranching and cattle-ranching if current conditions do not change (Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. 2006). In addition, studies have shown that densities of large-bodied Amazonian primates such as <em>Alouatta</em> spp. are often reduced by as much as 50-75% in areas of heavy hunting (Peres and Palacios 2007). In the Atlantic Forest region, where habitat loss and fragmentation has been due largely to the expansion of sugar cane plantations, remaining small forest patches are vulnerable to stochastic and demographic  effects.","It is inferred and suspected that the current distribution of the taxon is reduced relative to its historical extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), as much of its distribution in the Amazon region is included in the “Arc of Deforestation” and in the Atlantic Forest, its AOO is now extremely small and fragmented. The Guaribas Biological Reserve, for example, is an area of confirmed local extinction where the species has recently been reintroduced.<br/><br/><em>Alouatta belzebul</em> is extremely common in some areas (such as Marajó, Pará), but very rare in the Atlantic Forest portion of the range. The total population size in the Atlantic Forest is inferred to be less than 500 individuals and not more than 250 mature individuals, distributed in 18 isolated areas: one in Rio Grande do Norte, ten in Paraíba, one in Pernambuco and six in Alagoas (Fialho <em>et al.</em> 2014). The largest population in the Atlantic Forest is probably found in Pacatuba locality (Paraiba). However, it appears that the Amazonian population has more than 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>At the north of the state of Tocantins, near the municipality of Estreito, population abundance for the species over four forest fragments from 65 to 900 ha, is calculated to range from 1.35 to 3.72 individuals/10 km. For this region the estimated total population is about 141 individuals, living in altered isolated forest fragments.",Decreasing,"<em>Alouatta belzebul</em> is endemic to Brazil presenting a disjunct distribution, with a group of populations in the eastern portion of the Amazon and another in the Atlantic Forest.<br/><br/>The Amazonian population has its eastern boundary in the “Mata dos Cocais” in the states of Maranhão and Tocantins, where the geographic distribution coincides with the limits of the Amazon biome. The Xingu River is apparently the western boundary. In the north the species is limited by the Amazon River, although there are records of populations in southern Amapá (Gregorin 2006) and Oriximiná, Pará (Bonvicino <em>et al.</em> 1989). The latter may be a mistake because Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2009 reported that the species occurring in Oriximiná was <em>A. macconnelli</em>, widely distributed on the northern bank of the Amazon River. Further surveys are needed at the headwaters of the Xingu and in the Xingu-Iriri interfluve to establish what species of <em>Alouatta</em> occur in these areas. At the northern end of the state of Tocantins, the species is sympatric with <em>A. caraya</em> with isolated populations north of the city of Babaçulândia, where Fabiano R. de Melo and Raony M. Alencar (pers. comm.) found a mixed group (<em>A. caraya</em> female with <em>A. belzebul</em> male), demonstrating the existence of a small contact zone in the region.<br/><br/>The Atlantic Forest population currently occurs in 18 forest fragments, one in Pernambuco, one in Rio Grande do Norte (northern limit) and the remainder in the states of Paraíba and Alagoas.

By contrast, in Ceará the species survives only on hill tops and steep slopes, where populations are inaccessible to hunters and where the forest is protected by law. The sugarcane plantations along the middle and lower Parnaíba, rural settlements and charcoal production represent additional threats. A reduction in rainfall in the region, due to climate change, could be the dominant threat in the long term.","All known populations are small and isolated.

Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), the howler monkeys generally have quite small and broadly overlapping home ranges, of 5 ha up to 45 ha, depending on the type of habitat (Neville <em>et al.</em> 1988).&#160;<br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria.<br/><br/>Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days. Interbirth intervals are generally about 16.6 months, although they may be shortened by the death of an infant to about 10.5 months (Crockett and Sekulic 1984).","Hunting and habitat loss are localised threats, but human population density is relatively low, and neither is likely to be driving significant range-wide declines.&#160; It is not known if the rarity of this species along the left bank of the middle and upper Tapajós is largely a result of hunting by gold miners or some natural factor within its range, perhaps involving competition with related atelids, spider monkeys and woolly monkeys. Under any circumstances the species is heavily hunted, as are other atelids in the Amazon, <em>Ateles </em>spp. and <em>Lagothrix </em>spp.",There is no information available on population densities.,Decreasing,"<em>Alouatta nigerrima</em> occurs south of the Rio Amazonas in Brazil, west from the rios Tapajós and Juruena, to the Rios Madeira and Aripuanã, to about 9ºS. There are outlying populations north of the Rio Amazonas in the region of Oriximiná and Óbidos on the lower Rio Trombetas (Napier 1976) and just south of the Rio Amazonas-Solimões, midway between the rios Madeira and Purus, at the Lago Janauacá (A.

Local people say that the southernmost known locality is Igapó-Açu (R. Sampaio, pers. comm.). Red howlers, presumably, <em>A. puruensis</em>, occur on both sides of the Aripuanã, at the Cachoeira de Dardanelos, Aripuanã, 10°10’S, 59°27’W).

Long-term studies of this species have been carried out at Hato Masaguaral, Guarico, in seasonally inundated ""<em>bajo llanos</em>"". Troth (1979) describes the vegetation on the ranch. It is otherwise known from the biogeographic region of the North coast range (approximately 62ºW to 69ºW), where there are humid rain forest patches, either lowland tropical or pre-montane, resulting from orographic rainfall. Some mountains rise to elevations exceeding 2,000 m and in some ranges there are true montane cloud forests (Eisenberg and Redford 1979). <br/><br/>The Howler Monkeys are the large leaf-eaters of the South American primate communities. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. They spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting about quietly among the branches, fermenting leaves in their enlarged caecums. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaw which surrounds the enlarged larynx and hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber.  It is with this enlarged and highly specialised voice box that they produce their howls (grunts, roars and barks). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 km (Drubbel and Gautier 1993).<br/><br/>Howler groups are usually small, ranging in size from 2-16 animals and averaging 4-10 (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988).  Mean group size in Hato Masaguaral, Guarico State, Venezuela, ranged 7.7 to 10.5 at various times in the period 1969 to 1984 (Crockett and Eisenberg 1984). Mean numbers of adult males per group ranged 1.1 to 1.8, and adult females from 2.3 to 2.9. Group size in another ranch in the llanos, Hato El Frío, was 7.6 (Braza <em>et al.</em> 1981). In the red howlers, there is usually only one dominant male in the group (occasionally two), others being sub-adults, or juveniles, along with a harem of two to five females. Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), the Howler Monkeys generally have quite small and broadly overlapping home ranges, of 5 ha up to 45 ha, depending on the type of habitat (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988). The large groups of <em>A. palliata</em> may have home ranges extending to 60 ha (Estrada 1982), whereas in the llanos of northern Venezuela, home ranges of <em>A. arctoidea</em> can be as small as 4 ha (Sekulic 1982).  <br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria.<br/><br/>Crockett and Rudran (1987a,b) examined seasonal variation in births in red howlers from northern Venezuela, and found that they were less frequent during the early wet season (weaning would occur at the time of greatest food shortage). Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days. Interbirth intervals are generally about 16.6 months, although they may be shortened by the death of an infant to about 10.5 months (Crockett and Sekulic 1984). Crockett and Rudran (1987a,b) reviewed long-term demographic data on births at Hato Masaguaral, examining seasonality and interannual and habitat differences. Mean gestation length is 191 days (range 186-194, n=6) (as for <em>A. seniculus seniculus</em> in Crockett and Sekulic 1982).<br/><br/>Size: <br/>As for <em>Alouatta seniculus</em>, Venezuela<br/>Adult male 6.31 kg (n=64) (Rodríguez and Boher 1988)<br/>Adult female 4.67 kg (n=46) (Rodríguez and Boher 1988).",The main threat to this species is hunting.,"Between 15 to 118 individuals/km² have been recorded in Venezuela (Defler 2003). Rudran and Fernandez-Duque (2003) report on 30 years of demographic data on this species at the Hato Masaguaral, Guarico State, Venezuela. Habitats there include a continuous gallery forest along the Río Guarico and forest patches in seasonally inundated grasslands. Populations on the ranch ranged from a peak of 346 in 1989/1990 to 99 in 1999; population densities from 223 to 58 individuals/km². Population increases were found to result in part from increases in group size and in part from increases in the numbers of groups. The authors <span style="""">found </span>that density was a good predictor of the size of established and new groups. A gradual increase from 146 in 1970 to 346 in 1989/1990 was partly due to habitat regeneration. The decline in the population from 1990 to 1999 was believed to result from disease and food shortage, the latter resulting in stress, longer distances travelled to find food, less nutritious diets, and increased susceptibilty to botfly infestations. Short-term fluctuations were related to rainfall, drier years reducing population growth. Crockett and Eisenberg (1986) and Crockett (1996) examine particular aspects of demography, habitat and group size in this species.",Unknown,"<em>Alouatta arctoidea</em> is endemic to Venezuela. Its range, following Hill (1962) and Bodini and Pérez-Hernández (1987), is along the Venezuelan coast, east of Lake Maracaibo from Falcón to the state of Miranda. Bodini and Pérez-Hernández (1987) indicated that the howler monkey north of the Río Orinoco and west through Apure basin north of the Rio Meta, widely distributed throughout the Venezuelan <em>llanos</em>, is a distinct, as yet undescribed, form. Linares (1998), however, considered it to  be <em>A. arctoidea</em>. Linares (1998) descibed its range as the Cordillera Oriental, Cordillera Central and the Coro System along northern Venezuela, extending south throughout the <em>llanos</em> to the Río Orinoco, between 10 m and 1,160 m asl.

17926390,39916,Alouatta guariba,Vulnerable,A4ce,2020,2020-03-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although it is present in a wide range in the Atlantic Forest, Brown Howler Monkey has suffered from extensive habitat loss and fragmentation. It is suspected that the predominant scenario of small isolated subpopulations may aggravate the synergistic demographic and genetic effects of the already severely fragmented habitat. Also, the species suffers hunting pressure at different levels within its distribution range. Furthermore, it is highly susceptible to yellow fever, and an outbreak in 2008-2009 killed many individuals in southern Brazil. Lots of its subpopulations are impacted by urban expansion and infrastructure development, leading increasingly to vehicle and power line accidents and the predation by dogs. The yellow fever epidemic, coupled with ongoing habitat degradation, hunting pressure and other threats, has resulted in ongoing population decline, suspected to be at least 30% over three generations (36 years; 2008-2044). Thus, the species is listed as Vulnerable (VU) under criterion A4ce.","The species is an inhabitant of lowland, submontane and montane forest along the Atlantic coast of Brazil. It extends inland to the mesophytic, semideciduous, seasonal forest in the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Paraná (Mendes 1985, 1989; Chiarello 1993, 1995, 1999; Rylands<em> et al</em>. 1998; Marques 2001). In Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, it occurs in the highly seasonal, subtropical and temperate, mixed broadleaf/Araucaria forest (Schneider and Marques 1999; Buss 2001). Aguiar <em>et al.</em> (2007) recorded it in periodically flooded, seasonal, semideciduous forest in the floodplains of the Rio Paraná in Paraná State. In Rio Grande do Sul it occurs also in seasonal deciduous forest fragments (Fortes 2008). Buss<em> et al.</em> (2009) reported the occurrence of <em>A. g. clamitans</em> in different vegetation types at Itapuã State Park, i.e. meso-hygrophilous, hygrophilous and sub-xerophilous forests. Only in Rio Grande do Sul individuals of this taxon have been found on forested sandbanks (psammophilous forest; Fialho 2000), and in the Banhado dos Pachecos Wildlife Refuge it occurs in swamp forest (Bicca-Marques, unpublished data).&#160; There are no reports that the species was observed in mangroves. The taxon is not restricted to primary habitats, suggesting that the species is tolerant to environmental changes and human disturbances.<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are the large leaf-eaters within the South American primate communities. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for chewing leaves through shearing. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the underside of the tail tip. The most characteristic feature is the deep lower jaw, which encompasses the enlarged larynx and the hyoid apparatus, forming a resonating chamber. With this enlarged and highly specialized voice box howler monkeys produce their howls, grunts, roars and barks. Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard at distances of 1-2 km, particularly in the early morning (Drubbel and Gautier 1993). <br/><br/>Brown Howler Monkeys live in groups of four to five individuals, reaching a maximum of 13 individuals (Alves and Zau 2007, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2011, Jardim 2005, Ingberman <em>et al.</em> 2009, Miranda and Passos 2005). Ingberman <em>et al.</em> (2009) reported a mean group size of 4.5 (range: 1 to 6) individuals in 10 observed groups in the Ilha do Cardoso State Park. The authors compiled data from 16 additional studies, finding mean group sizes ranging from 1.8 to 9.4 individuals, and a maximum group size of 13 individuals. In Forest Hemlock in Rio de Janeiro State, Alves and Zau (2007) observed a mean group size of 5.8 (range: 3 to 8) individuals, based on four groups, each with a single adult male. Miranda and Passos (2005) reported 5 groups with a mean group size of 6.3 individuals (range: 4 to 10), including 1 to 2 adult males and 1 to 3 adult females.<br/><br/>There is usually only one dominant male in each group (occasionally two) with a harem of two to five females. Others males are either subordinate younger males, sub-adults, or juveniles. Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), howler monkeys have generally small and broadly overlapping home ranges. Home range size, however, varies depending on the type of habitat type (Neville<em> et al.</em> 1988). Bicca-Marques (2003) mentions a variation in home size ranging from 3.9 to 33.0 ha (mean ± SD = 10.2 ± 8.1, N = 11). Fortes (2008) studied a group that used two small forest fragments summing not more than 1 ha. Miranda and Passos (2011) documented variation in home range size reaching from 1.8 to 33 ha (mean ± SD = 10.0 ± 7.9, N = 15). A more recent review reported an average home range size of 13.0 ha (SD = 15.9; Fortes <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Howler monkeys are the only New World primates that regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the key factors for their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. In many regions mature fruits are another important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>), but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, mosses, stems, twigs, and even termites.<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Mean adult male weight: 6.73 kg (N=4); mean adult female weight: 4.35 kg (N=5) (Smith and Jungers 1997).","Widespread forest loss and fragmentation throughout its range are the main threats to <em>Alouatta guariba</em>. Its distributional range largely correlates with the most densely populated regions of Brazil. Only 12% of the original forest coverage is remaining in these areas, fragmented into almost 250 forest fragments, 83.4% of which are smaller than 50 ha (Ribeiro<em> et al. </em>2009). It is suspected that the current scenario of small isolated subpopulations, may progressively aggravate the synergistic, demographic and genetic effects of the severely fragmented habitat, including the increase of inbreeding. However, the species is able to survive in quite small forest fragments if there is no hunting. Especially in the northern part of its range it suffers from hunting pressure at different levels (Canale <em>et al</em>. 2012). Furthermore, the species is highly susceptible to yellow fever, and an outbreak in 2008-2009 killed a large number of individuals, with local extinctions recorded in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Almeida <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fialho <em>et al</em>. 2012), and Misiones, Argentina (Holzmann <em>et al. </em>2010). This epidemic resulted in lethal aggression from local communities due to a fear of direct transmission from howler monkeys (Bicca-Marques and Freitas 2010). In addition, many subpopulations are affected by urban expansion and infrastructure developments. This includes accidents with vehicles and power lines and predation by dogs (Printes 1999, Pasquotto <em>et al</em>. 2002, Galetti and Sazima 2006, Fries <em>et al.</em> 2007, Lokschin <em>et al.</em> 2007, São Paulo (Cidade) 2011, Buss 2012).","Although the size of the total remaining population is unknown, there are a fair number of population estimates throughout the range of this species and it is suspected that the number of mature individuals exceeds the threshold of 10,000 individuals. Pinto <em>et al.</em> (2009) reported at least eight subpopulations with more than 500 individuals, estimated by using linear transect surveys in the Atlantic Forest area of southern and southeastern Brazil. Most of those studies were carried out in very small forest fragments. González-Solís <em>et al.</em> (2001) provided a summary, listing 11 sites (forests; ranging from 50 ha to 100,000 ha) where brown howlers were counted.<br/><br/>Densities can be very high. When not hunted, densities can vary, even within very small forest fragments due to being folivorous and their dietary flexibility. In a 50-ha site at Lageadinho in São Paulo State, group size was 6-12 individuals, and the density was estimated as 98 individuals/km² (Torres de Assumpção 1983). Chiarello (1993) recorded a density of 177 individuals/km² at the Santa Genebre Reserve (259 ha) in São Paulo State. Density estimates at the Caratinga Biological Station (survey area ranging from 570 to 800 ha) in Minas Gerais, varied from 92 to 149 individuals/km² (Mendes 1985, 1989; Hirsch 1995). Lower densities, e.g. 10.1 individuals/km², were recorded by Pinto <em>et al.</em> (1993) in the Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (4,000 ha) in Espírito Santo State. Hirsch (1995) estimated densities of 1.8 to 49.0 individuals/km² in the Rio Doce State Park (32,210 ha) in Minas Gerais. González-Solís <em>et al</em>. (2001) estimated only a density of 0.79 individuals/km² in four contiguous protected areas of the Serra do Paranapiacaba in the state of São Paulo, totalling about 140,000 ha (i.e., the state parks of Intervales, Turístico Alto Ribeira and Carlos Botelho, and the Xitué State Ecological Station). Surveys by Chiarello (1995) in the Linhares Forest Reserve, Espírito Santo failed to register howlers even though they were present. During later surveys in the same reserve, Chiarello (1999) recorded an encounter rate of 0.15 groups/10 km. Schneider and Marques (1999) estimated a density of 92-125 individuals/km² in the southern part of the range of this species, in mixed broadleaf/Araucaria forest in the Aracuri-Esmeralda Ecological Station. Buss (2001) estimated 65 to 85 individuals/km² in the Itapuã State Park. Ingberman <em>et al.</em> (2009) reported 10.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> or 2.4 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in Cardoso Island State Park. The same authors compiled data from 16 studies using different methods and obtained values ​​from 0.4 to 260 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>. Pinto <em>et al</em>. (2009) mentioned a variation in population density reaching from 0.3 to 176.8 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (N=20). Chiarello and Melo (2001) surveyed seven forest fragments in Espírito Santo, varying in size from 210 to 24,250 ha, and found the species in very low abundance. In two of these fragments (Sooretama Biological Reserve: 24,250 ha; Rio Preto National Forest: 2,822 ha) only by vocalization, in two others (Linhares Forest Reserve: 21,800 ha; M7/317: 260 ha) by a single encounter. Lower densities seem to occur in large and continuous forests. On the other hand, higher densities are found in small, isolated or peri-urban forest fragments.<br/><br/>The above quoted density estimates are mainly the result of a number of behavioural and ecological field studies conducted on this species. The study sites chosen are those where howler monkeys were found to be numerous and visible. Thus, the high densities reported are undoubtedly at the top end of the possible range and do not reflect a situation typical for the entire distributional range of the species. At localities where they are hunted they will occur in much lower densities, or not at all. In some areas they are scarce even though hunting is minimal or absent (for example, the Rio Doce State Park or the Augusto Ruschi Biological Station). The reason for low population densities in these areas is generally sought to be disease epidemics, especially yellow fever.<br/><br/>In Misiones, Argentina, densities of both <em>A.</em> <em>guariba</em> and <em>A. caraya</em> are extremely low, probably as a result of the dramatic habitat fragmentation observed in the last few decades, and due to repeated yellow fever outbreaks (1966, 2008-2009).",Decreasing,"<em>Alouatta guariba </em>inhabits a large part of the Atlantic Forest, along the coast of eastern Brazil. Its distributional range extends from Rio de Contas in southern Bahia (formerly south of the Rio Paraguaçu) (Neves<em> et al. </em>2015a, b), south to the basin of the Rio Camaquã, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Printes <em>et al.</em> 2001), and further to the extreme North of Argentina in the province of Misiones (Crespo 1954; Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1998; Di Bitetti <em>et al</em>. 1994; Rylands 1994; Marques 2003). <em>Alouatta g. clamitans </em>occurs in sympatry with <em>A. caraya</em> in the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil (Aguiar <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2014; Bicca-Marques <em>et al. </em>2008) and in the Province of Misiones in Argentina (Agostini <em>et al. </em>2008). Hybridization between these two taxa is suspected in the contact zone and was observed in captivity (Jesus<em> et al</em>. 2010).&#160;Kinsey (1981) argued that the Rio Doce separated the northern subspecies (<em>Alouatta g. guariba</em>) from the southern subspecies (<em>A. g. clamitans</em>). However, throughout a large part of their range, i.e. north of the Rio Doce, howler monkeys were indistinguishable from those to the South of the river (S. Mendes pers. comm.). Surveys by Rylands <em>et al</em>. (1988) resulted in the discovery of groups just south of the lower Jequitinhonha River, which were all pale gold in colour, whereas further west, north of the middle Jequitinhonha, groups in deciduous forests showed sexual dichromatism typical of <em>clamitans</em> occurring further south (females dark brown, males golden brown). North of the Jequitinhonha River, only a few records of brown howler monkeys were reported, and only a few viable populations remain (Neves <em>et al. </em>2015a,b). If the uniformly pale howlers of the lower Jequitinhonha are, in fact, a distinct subspecies (the nominate subspecies), then the populations must be minuscule. However, the validity of the two subspecies remains doubtful. Also, recent genetic analysis, comparing populations from the south of the species’ range in the states of Santa Catarina, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro suggest a strong subpopulation differentiation within clamitans (Jerusalinsky 2001, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2005, Martins<em> et al.</em> 2011).",The species suffers from high hunting pressure for consumption or for cultural use (to remove the hyoid bone used in rituals and folk medicine)..,Terrestrial,"<p>Some initiatives focus on the conservation of the southern subspecies, <em>Alouatta guariba clamitans</em>, since the early 1990’s, implementing research and management actions. The Projeto Bugio (Howler Project) is an initiative of the Indaial Biological Research Center (CEPESBI), maintained by the Municipality of Indaial and the University Foundation of Blumenau (FURB). Since 1992 they have conducted research, environmental education, management of individuals and conservation activities in the northern region of the Santa Catarina State (Projeto Bugio 2016).<br/><br/> In 1993 the Programa Macacos Urbanos (Urban Monkeys Program), linked to the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and recently recognized as a Nucleus of Universitary Extension (NEMU/UFRGS), implemented a transdisciplinary approach towards the species conservation (Jerusalinsky<em> et al</em>. 2010). Actions implemented include: creation of new protected areas (Printes <em>et al</em>. 2010), environmental education activities (Teixeira <em>et al.</em> 2011) and the installation of rope bridges in the south of the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, by the Urban Monkeys Program (NEMU/UFRGS) to minimize road kills, dog attacks and electric shock accidents with public power lines (Lokschin <em>et al</em>. 2007; Teixeira <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The municipality of São Paulo has developed a number of reintroductions and environmental education activities of local communities (São Paulo (Cidade), 2009a; São Paulo (Cidade) 2009b; Alencar Jr. <em>et al.</em> 2011; São Paulo (Cidade) 2012).<br/><br/>The northern subspecies, <em>Alouatta guariba guariba</em>, was included in the Central Atlantic Forest National Action Plan, elaborated by ICMBio and collaborators in 2010, establishing a series of conservation strategies by means of research and management of the species and its habitats. As part of these strategies, the Projeto Barbado-Vermelho (Red-Howler Project), coordinated by&#160;IESB&#160;in cooperation with the National Center for Research and Conservation of Brazilian Primates (ICMBio/CPB) and the Uiraçu&#160;Institute, is developing research and management actions.

17926817,40642,Alouatta macconnelli,Least Concern,,2020,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Alouatta macconnelli</em> is listed as Least Concern given its widespread distribution and apparent lack of any major threats driving a significant population decline. Rates of forest loss within its range (eastern Venezuela, eastern Colombia and the interior forests of Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana) are currently low and projected to be so for at least the next few generations.&#160; It occurs in numerous and large protected areas and is not as susceptible to hunting as are the other atelids.","This species is found in primary lowland rain forest, gallery forest, and dry deciduous forest. In Suriname, <em>A. macconnelli</em> is found most often in high rain forest, but occurs in many other forest types as well, including riverbank high forest, marsh forest (creek forest and Mora forest), swamp forest, Pterocarpus-Tabebuia swamp, savanna forest (including Eperua falcata forest), mountain savanna forest and ridge forest. It is also sometimes seen in liana forest, in swamp scrub and mangrove forest, although it appears to be quite rare in these formations (Mittermeier 1977). In Guyana, it is one of the commonest species along rivers (Muckenhirn <em>et al. </em>1975). Kinzey <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported it to be common in the areas they surveyed in the eastern part of the state of Bolívar in Venezuela (Río Caroni and Río Supamo), and elsewhere in the country it is known from secondary forests, highly seasonal semi-deciduous forests, gallery forests and mangrove forest, as well as forest tracts in the llanos (Neville <em>et al.</em> 1988). Howlers spend most of their time in the middle to upper canopy, although they will use all levels, and may even go to the ground to cover short distances between trees.<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are frugivore-folivores. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. They spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting about quietly among the branches, fermenting leaves in their enlarged caecums. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaws which surround the enlarged larynx and hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber. It is with this enlarged and highly specialized voice box that they produce their howls (grunts, roars and barks). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 kms (Drubbel and Gautier 1993). The red howlers (<em>A. seniculus, A. macconnelli, A. juara, A. puruensis, and A. sara</em>) have the largest voice boxes and the deepest roars, while the Mexican, Central American and northern Colombian mantled howlers, <em>A. palliata</em> and <em>A. pigra</em>, have the smallest, and their howls are more high pitched as a result.<br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (Ficus) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria.<br/><br/>The diet of <em>A. macconnelli</em> has been studied by Mittermeier and van Roosmalen (1981) in Suriname and more recently during a long-term study in the Nouragues Field Station in French Guiana (Julliot and Sabatier 1993; Julliot 1994a,b, 1996a,b). It feeds mainly on soft parts of many different kinds of fruits, as well as flowers and young leaves. Also included in the diet are mature leaves, immature fruits, moss, bark, and the soil of termitaria. Julliot and Sabatier (1993) recorded the use of 195 plant species from 47 families. Seeds are ingested, but only rarely eaten. As a result <em>Alouatta</em>, like <em>Ateles</em>, is an important seed disperser. Julliot (1996a) found that <em>A. macconnelli</em> dispersed the seeds of more than 95% of more than 100 plant species (especially Sapotaceae) from which they ate fruit over the two years of her observations. <br/><br/><em>Alouatta palliata</em> may form large groups of more than 40 individuals, with a number of breeding males but group sizes can be smaller, averaging 14. For the other species, 14 is a large group, and they can usually be seen numbering four or five or up to 11 or so individuals. In Suriname,<em> A. macconnelli </em>lives in small groups that usually include one adult male, one or more adult females and one or more juveniles and infants. Twenty-four groups counted in various parts of Suriname ranged in size from 2-8 and averaged 4.25 animals per group (Mittermeier 1977). In the largest group observed (eight animals), one of the two adult males was definitely peripheral. Husson (1957) mentions groups of 5-6 in Suriname, and in French Guiana, Julliot (1992) studied a group over two years which varied from 6-8 individuals. In Mittermeier’s (1977) study, the home ranges for three groups in the Voltzberg study area on which adequate data are available were 6 ha, 10 ha and 11 ha over a one-year period. Julliot’s (1992) study group in French Guiana had a larger home range, however, encompassing 45 ha over two years.<br/><br/>Infant <em>Alouatta</em> are probably born throughout the year in Suriname, but data are not yet sufficient to determine if there is a birth peak. In Suriname, newborn infants have been seen in March, April, and November, and January (Mittermeier 1977). Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days. Interbirth intervals are generally about 16.6 months, although they may be shortened by the death of an infant to about 10.5 months (Crockett and Sekulic 1984). Mean gestation length is 191 days (range 186-194, n=6) (as for <em>A. seniculus seniculus</em> in Crockett and Sekulic 1982).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Adult male weight 5.2-7.1 kg (mean 6.2 kg, n=4), adult female weight 4.1-5.0 kg (mean 4.5 kg, n=3) (Ford and Davis 1992).","There are no major range-wide threats, but they are affected locally by some hunting, and, in the southern part of its range, there is deforestation due to cattle ranching.","The population density of <em>Alouatta macconnelli</em> at the Voltzberg study area in Suriname has been estimated at 17 individuals/km² (Mittermeier 1977). In Guyana, Muckenhirn <em>et al.</em> (1975) registered an overall density of 7.5 animals/km², but local densities varied from 4.7-63.8 individuals/km². The population density estimated over nine years at the Nouragues Field Station in French Guiana was 18.9 individuals/km², having the largest biomass of the primate community there at 144.6 kg/km² (Guillotin <em>et al</em>. 1994). More recent surveys at Nouragues by Kessler (1998) provided density estimates of 11-15 individuals/km² or 2-3 groups/km². <em>Alouatta macconnelli</em> shows mean group size of 5 ind/group (Gregorin <em>et al. </em>2008)",Stable,"<em>Alouatta macconnelli</em> occurs throughout a large part of the Guiana Shield, north of the Rio Amazonas, east of the Rio Negro and east and south of the Rio Orinoco (Gregorin 2006). It would seem that it occurs on the Ilha Tupinambarana, between the rios Tapajós and Madeira south the Rio Amazonas, along with <em>Alouatta nigerrima</em> (Gregorin 2006). The distribution and taxonomy in Brazil were discussed by Gregorin (2006), and the distribution in Venezuela by Bodini and Pérez-Hernández (1987).",They are affected locally by some hunting.,Terrestrial,"This species is present in numerous, and large, protected areas:<br/><br/>Brazil <br/><ul><li>Tumucumaque National Park (3,882,376 ha)</li><li>Cabo Orange National Park (630,017 ha)</li><li>Lago Piratuba Biological Reserve (394,223 ha)</li><li>Rio Trombetas Biological Reserve (409,578 ha)</li><li>FLONA Saracà-Taquera (429,000 ha)</li><li>Uatumã Biological Reserve (942,786 ha)</li><li>Jari Ecolopical Station (207,370 ha)</li></ul>French Guiana<br/><ul><li>Nouragues Natural Reserve (100,000 ha)</li><li>Kaw Reserved Area  (76,800 ha) </li></ul>Guyana<br/><ul><li>Kaietur National Park (11,655 ha)</li><li>Iwokrama Forest Reserve (364,000 ha)</li></ul>Suriname<br/><ul><li>Brinckheuvel Nature Reserve (6,000 ha) (unconfirmed: Mittermeier and van Roosmalen 1982)</li><li>Central Suriname Nature Reserve (1,600,000 ha) (Mittermeier and van Roosmalen 1982)</li><li>Coppename Monding Nature Reserve (12,000 ha) (unconfirmed: Mittermeier and van Roosmalen 1982)</li><li>Sipaliwini Nature Reserve (100,000 ha) (Mittermeier and van Roosmalen 1982)</li><li>Wia-wia Nature Reserve (36,000 ha) (Mittermeier and van Roosmalen 1982)</li><li>Brownsberg Nature Park (8,400 ha) (Mittermeier and van Roosmalen 1982; Norconk <em>et al</em>. 2003).</li></ul>It is listed on Appendix II of CITES.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
17927228,2993,Brachyteles arachnoides,Critically Endangered,A2cd,2019,2019-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> is listed CR based on an inferred or suspected population reduction of at least 80% over the past 60 years (three generations), corresponding to a decline in area of occupancy (AOO) estimated at more than 80%. Population reduction due to habitat loss has been exacerbated by hunting, which has resulted in the extirpation of small- to medium-sized sub-populations and continues to be a significant threat, even in protected areas.","The species inhabits submontane and montane evergreen tropical forest of the Atlantic coast of Brazil. According to Aguirre (1971), <em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> is found in montane forests between 400-1,880 meters asl, in well-preserved remnants of seasonal and evergreen forests. Recent data indicate the resilience of the taxon in subtropical/tropical montane and deciduous evergreen forests, between 400-1,880 m asl (Talebi in prep). Studies on dietary requirements and feeding ecology were conducted in the Fazenda Barreiro Rico by Milton (1984) and Martins (2003a,b, 2005b, 2006), in the Intervales State Park (Petroni 1993, 2000) and in the Carlos Botelho State Park (Moraes 1992a,b; Lucas <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2016; Ganzhorn <em>et al.</em> 2009; Talebi 2005; Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2016; Talebi 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Size:</strong><br/>Adult male size: 1.57 m crown rump size (Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2016)<br/>Adult female size: 1.44 m crown rump size (Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2016)<br/>Adult male weight: 9.1 kg (n=7) (Talebi and Lee 2010)<br/>Adult female weight: 8.3 kg (n=4) (Talebi and Lee 2010)","Historically, forest loss and hunting have been the two most significant threats to <em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em>.<br/><br/>Estimates of the original distribution of the genus <em>Brachyteles</em> are based in large part on the studies of Aguirre (1971), undertaken nearly 50 years ago. Recent Spatial Distribution Modelling (SDM) estimates the species’ original area of occupancy (AOO) at 345,760 km², within which only 20,611 km² of suitable habitat remains, representing what must be regarded as an irreversible loss of 96% (Ingberman <em>et al</em>. 2016). Deforestation has occurred largely due to an expanding agricultural frontier, cattle ranching, urbanization and development.<br/><br/>The current population of the Southern Muriqui is believed to be less than 1,200 individuals surviving in 20 isolated, subpopulations in a mixture of private, municipal, state and national protected areas in the states of Rio de Janeiro (6), Sao Paulo (12) and Parana&#160; (2) (Strier <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Of the subpopulations, one (Carlos Botelho State Park) is believed to contain between 100 and 250 mature individuals, while three (Serra dos Orgaos National Park, Serra do Mar State Park and the Legado Das Aguas Votorantim Reserve) are believed to contain between 50 and 100 mature individuals (Strier <em>et al</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Hunting has been severe in past decades and continues to be a significant threat, even within officially protected areas. Since the first regional survey of the two <em>Brachyteles </em>species was conducted nearly 60 years ago, the extirpation of at least a dozen former populations of the Southern Muriqui is believed to have occurred (Aguirre 1971, Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1998, Melo <em>et al</em>. 2005, Nogueira <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Talebi, pers. comm).","<em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> is now known to survive in 20 localities: 12 in São Paulo State, two in Parana State, and six in Rio de Janeiro State. The estimated total population is 1,100-1,200 individuals, inhabiting a combination of national, state, municipal and private protected areas, as well as unprotected forests (Talebi and Soares 2016, Strier <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest subpopulations are those of Carlos Botelho State Park, Serra dos Orgaos National Park, Serra do Mar State Park and the Legado Das Aguas Votorantim Reserve. Several of the subpopulations in São Paulo State exist in small, isolated forest patches and their long-term viability is questionable, while the sub-populations of Tres Picos, Desengano State Park, Cunhambebe State and Serra da Bocaina National Park may actually be larger than previously estimated (Strier <em>et al</em>. 2017). However, a significant number of subpopulations identified by Aguirre (1971) have apparently been extirpated.",Decreasing,"The geographic distribution of <em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> ranges from the northeast region of Paraná along the central and eastern region of São Paulo State and the southern region of Rio de Janeiro (Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2011). To the north it occurs as far as the southern margin of the Paraíba do Sul River and to the west of this river, it could have reached the south-eastern parts of Minas Gerais on the southern slopes of the Serra da Mantiqueira. One population still exists in the delta of the Piracicaba and Tiete Rivers.<br/><br/>Its stronghold today is in the southern region of Sâo Paulo State, in the montane forests of the Serra de Paranapiacaba (Talebi 2005, Talebi and Soares 2005). Based on Koehler <em>et al</em>. (2005) the species’ range in Paraná State is restricted to the south by the Ribeira de Iguape River and to the west by the Campo Biome. Within this range, there are only two populations remaining, one at Castro Municipality and another in Doutor Ulysses Municipality. Throughout the region, the only remnant forest of any considerable size is that of the Lauráceas State Park (23,000 ha), in a montane region of the Municipalities of Adrianópolis and Tunas do Paraná (Ingberman 2015). In São Paulo State, there are three main strongholds for the species. These are the Serra de Paranapiacaba, in the dense montane forests of&#160; the Municipalities of São Miguel Arcanjo and Capão Bonito, the Carlos Botelho State Park (24°15-44’S, 47°46-48°10´W), and the Fundação Florestal do Estado de São Paulo. Additional field sites protecting known subpopulations in the region include a protected private reserve, i.e., the Muriqui Ecopark (Pró-Muriqui Association), and two corporate private business areas, i.e., Fazenda São Miguel Klabin and Legado das Águas Reserve Votorantim. These areas represent the core areas of the World Heritage Site Atlantic Forest South-East Reserves (decreed in 1999 and considered of outstanding universal value in 2015).<br/><br/>For the Serra do Mar region containing the largest protected area of São Paulo, the Parque Estadual Serra do Mar is supposed to protect the species. Although several areas have been proven to have experienced local extinctions, the exact distributional status of the species in the region is unknown, but is certainly declining. In the Serra da Mantiqueira, bordering the States of Minas Gerais and São Paulo, a few remnants of forest still remain and only two localities, the São Sebastião Fibria Farm (22°45´S 45°28´W) and the region of São Francisco Xavier (23°12’S 45°52’W) are confirmed as current areas in which the species survives. In addition, the last remnant of interior deciduous forest, the Barreiro Rico Farm, contains a vanishing population in the municipality of Anhembi, located in the deltas of the Tiete and Piracicaba Rivers (Talebi and Soares 2005, Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2016).

In 2000 the NGO Associação Pró-Muriqui was set up (PHVA Muriqui 1998) to ensure continued research activities in the park and elsewhere in São Paulo (Talebi and Soares 2005). At the present this long term research project monitors the populations of Carlos Botelho State Park, Legado das Águas, Sao Sebastiao Farm, São Miguel Farm and will soon start in Barreiro Rico. These and other science based conservation actions follow the guidelines of&#160; public conservation policies, the federal conservation policy, the National Action Plan Muriqui, the São Paulo State Conservation Public Policy, the Primate State Conservation Plan, and the directives published by the Pró-Primatas Comission (São Paulo State 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation policy: <br/></strong>A Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) was carried out for both species of <em>Brachyteles </em>in 1998 (Rylands<em> et al. </em>1998), which sparked a series of surveys in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Bahia and in São Paulo State. It further led to the foundation of the Associação Pró-Muriqui, a NGO coordinating research within São Paulo State. In 2002, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment (IBAMA) set up the Committee for the Conservation and Management of the Muriqui (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2005). In 2011 the Instituto Chico Mendes da Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBIO) published The National Action Plan Muriqui. In 2015, São Paulo State launched the Pró-Primatas Comission, a permanent commission responsible for elaborating conservation policies for state-wide action on threatened primate species.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ex situ</em> conservation</strong>:<br/>Captive breeding has been problematic due to low levels of reproduction and poor infant survival. There is a small, but promising, captive breeding programme for the species in Sorocaba Zoo, which has been successful on maintaining the species. There also exists the continued <em>ex situ</em> program for the species at Rio de Janeiro Primate Center (Coimbra- Filho <em>et al</em>. 1993, Pissinatti <em>et al.</em> 1998, Pissinatti 2005) but none of these institutions has been successful in regularly generating or maintaining offspring. The National Action Plan Muriqui established three reference institutions for captive breeding of the species, i.e., Sorocaba Zoo (São Paulo), Passeio Publico Zoo, Curitiba (Paraná), and Rio de Janeiro Primate Centre.&#160; Some zoos in São Paulo (e.g., Sorocaba and Santos) receive wild-born muriqui pets every year, originating mostly from palm-harvesters and hunters who have killed the mothers. Conservation planning for a dedicated breeding program in São Paulo State would greatly enhance our understanding of southern muriquis as well as providing a backup for population extinctions in the wild.<br/><br/>This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Population reduction due to habitat loss has been exacerbated by hunting, which has continues to be a significant threat, even in protected areas.","Inhabits the humid coastal forests of the Serra do Mar to the semideciduous forests inland in the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais.<br/><br/>Almost all of the information available on the ecology, behaviour, reproduction and demography of the northern muriqui comes from a single population at the Caratinga Biological Station (Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Feliciano Miguel Abdala), Minas Gerais. There, muriquis have been systematically monitored and researched since 1982 (Fonseca 1985; Strier 1987a,b, 1993/1994, 1999, 2000; Strier <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Size:</strong><br/>Adult male weight 9.25-9.6 kg (mean 9.4 kg, n=3) (Lemos de Sá and Glander 1993)<br/>Adult female weight 6.9-9.3 kg (mean 8.33 kg, n=3) (Lemos de Sá and Glander 1993)","Historically, forest loss and hunting have been the two most significant  threats to this species. Deforestation has occurred largely due to an  expanding agricultural frontier, cattle ranching, urbanization and  development. Hunting has been severe in past decades and continues to be  a significant threat, even within officially protected areas.<br/><br/>Since the first regional survey of the two <em>Brachyteles</em>  species was conducted nearly 60 years ago, the extirpation of at least  two dozen former populations of the Northern Muriqui is believed to have  occurred (Aguirre 1971, Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1998, Melo <em>et al</em>. 2005, Nogueira <em>et al</em>. 2009). Spatial Distribution Modeling (SDM) estimates the historic range of <em>Brachyteles hypoxanthus</em> at 329,445 km² (Aguirre 1971), within which only 16,450 km² of suitable  habitat remains, representing a likely irreversible decline of the extent of suitable habitat of 95% over the last 45-50 years or three generations (Ingberman <em>et al</em>. 2016). In addition, based upon a detailed demographic analysis (Strier and Ives 2012), one of the two largest subpopulations (RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala) has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years and is considered unstable despite its overall growth.","The current population of the Northern Muriqui, <em>Brachyteles hypoxanthus</em>,  is believed to be less than 1,000 individuals total, surviving in 14 isolated,  subpopulations in a mixture of private, municipal, state and national  protected areas in the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro that cover a combined area of less than 200,000 ha (Mendes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jerusalinsky <em>et al.</em> 2011, Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Strier<em> et al</em>. 2017). The four largest subpopulations—RPPN Feliciano Miguel  Abdala, Serra do Brigadeiro State Park, Rio Doce State Park and Santa Maria do Jetiba—are given 'the greatest potential for persistence' (Strier and Ives 2012, Strier <em>et al</em>. 2017), while the remaining subpopulations are significantly smaller, all with numbers of mature individuals either in the low double-digits or even single digits, and may not be viable over the long-term (Jerusalinsky <em>et al</em>. 2011, Strier <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Even the largest subpopulation (RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala) has shown severe population fluctuations in recent years (Strier <em>et al.</em> 2017).",Decreasing,"The range of the northern muriqui (<em>B. hypoxanthus</em>) covers the Atlantic forest of the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Bahia, excluding the lowland forests in the extreme south of Bahia and northern Espírito Santo (Aguirre 1971, Melo <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mendes <em>et al.</em> 2005a, Melo 2005, Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2011). According to Aguirre (1971), the northern limit to its range was probably the Rio Jequiriçá basin, which flows into the Baía de Todos os Santos, and including the forests of the right bank of the Rio Paraguaçu. The southern limit is more poorly defined, but it probably extended to the Serra da Mantiqueira, in southern Minas Gerais, near to the state boundaries with Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo (Aguirre 1971,Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 1987, Lemos de Sá and Glander 1993, Strier and Fonseca 1996–1997).<br/><br/>Recently, a single known population in the state of Rio de Janeiro was confirmed in Itatiaia National Park (Cunha<em> et al.</em> 2009, Aximoff 2015). However, the population is already known since the 1990s (Hall 1995), but without assigning a specific status. According to Talebi <em>et al.</em> (2011), Northern Muriqui populations are located mostly in some forest fragments in Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, and have been virtually extinct in Bahia (Oliver and Santos 1991; Rylands <em>et al.</em> 1995, 2000; Melo <em>et al.</em> 2004). Currently a population of Northern Muriqui was recorded reported from Alto Cariri National Park, located in Guaratinga, Bahia. Another new population was recorded in the Wildlife Refuge Forest of Muriquis, located between the cities of Salto da Divisa and Santa Maria do Salto, both in Minas Gerais, at the border of Bahia State (Melo <em>et al. </em>2004). In addition, to the species’ records from&#160; the Itatiaia National Park at the border of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais States, there are unconfirmed reports of its presence in the environment of this protected area, specifically in Maramba (André Cunha pers. comm.) and in some municipalities of Minas Gerais, such as Itamonte (Marcelo Passamani pers. comm.). Search for muriquis in the forest is pretty easy because it is the largest primate in the neotropics with a unique long call vocalisation. However, most of the few remaining populations inhabit mountainous areas, which makes the exact definition of some distribution limits extremely difficult (Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2011). Given that there are currently only 13 known remaining populations (Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2011) in isolated forest fragments, and considering the virtual extinction of the species in Bahia (Oliver and Santos 1991; Rylands <em>et al. </em>1995, 2000) as well as the fact that its historical geographical distribution should cover the Atlantic Forest in those states (with the exception of the lowlands in southern Bahia and northern Espírito Santo; Aguirre 1971, Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2011.), it appears that the current distribution of the taxon is greatly reduced in relation to its historical occurrence (Mendes <em>et al. </em>2008a, 2008b; Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition, the local extinction of the species has been confirmed in many localities, including protected areas, such as the Biological Station of Santa Lucia - ES, Biological Station of St. Lawrence - ES, Forest Reserve Two Mouths - ES and Forest Reserve Pedra Azul - ES (Mendes 1991). The extent of its occurrence was estimated at 100,000 km²&#160;and its occurrence area is 1,870 km² (Mendes <em>et al.</em> 2008a, 2008b; Talebi<em> et al</em>. 2011).",The species is hunted for food and sport.,Terrestrial,"This species occurs in the following protected areas (Strier <em>et al.</em> 2017):<br/><ul><li>Caparaó National Park, Espírito Santo (31,853 ha) (Gomes and Melo 2005)</li><li>Itatiaia National Park, southern Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro (28,155 ha) (Aximoff 2015)<br/></li><li>Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve, Espírito Santo (3,573 ha) (Pinto <em>et al.</em> 1993, Vierira and Mendes, 2005, Carla Possamai pers. comm.)</li><li>Mata Escura Biological Reserve, Minas Gerais (50,890 ha) (Melo <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2004, Melo 2004)<br/></li><li>Ibitipoca State Park, Minas Gerais (1,488 ha) (Fontes <em>et al.</em> 1996, Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2003, Oliveira 2003, Ferraz <em>et al.</em> 2005)</li><li>Rio Doce State Park, Minas Gerais, (35,976 ha) (Mendes <em>et al</em>. 2005a,c)<br/></li><li>Serra do Brigadeiro State Park, Minas Gerais (13,210 ha) (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2003, Leandro S.

This has now resulted in a series of surveys in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and Bahia. From 1983 to 1998, the Caratinga Biological Station was the only long-term field station conducting research on this species (Strier and Boubli 2006), but following the PHVA workshop long-term research was also initiated in Espírito Santo, Santa Maria do Jetibá, by the Instituto de Pesquisas da Mata Atlântica (IPEMA) and by the Federal University of Espírito Santo. The use of population viability modelling has been continued since then as a tool for conservation planning for muriquis (Strier 1993/1994; Mendes <em>et al. </em>2005a; Brito and Grelle 2006). In 2002, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment (IBAMA) set up the Committee for the Conservation and Management of the Muriqui (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2005). <br/><br/>From 2001 to 2003 the Project for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Brazilian Biological Diversity (Projeto de Conservação e Utilização Sustentável da Diversidade Biológica Brasileira – PROBIO), of the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), approved financing three projects for the conservation and management of the northern muriqui. They are coordinated by three NGOs, the Instituto de Pesquisas da Mata Atlântica (IPEMA), the Fundação Biodiversitas, and the Instituto Dríades. Two important meetings resulted from this, the first in January 2003 in Santa Maria de Jetibá, Espírito Santo, and the second in March 2004 in Belo Horizonte. They provided the information and directives for the elaboration of a management plan for the species (in prep., see Mendes <em>et al. </em>2005a).<br/><br/>Currently, there are research programmes on, and conservation initiatives for, muriquis being carried out in six localities, four in Minas Gerais (RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala, RPPN Mata do Sossego, and Serra do Brigadeiro and Rio Doce state parks) and two in Espírito Santo (Caparaó National Park and Santa Maria de Jetibá). These studies and initiatives cover about 90% of the entire population of <em>B. hypoxanthus</em> (see Mendes<em> et al.</em> 2005a). Besides population monitoring and ecological/behavioural studies, research is being carried out on population genetics (Fagundes 2005; Chaves <em>et al. </em>2006), parasite infections and ecology (Stuart and Strier 1995; Pissinatti 2005), and captive breeding, veterinary aspects, nutrition, husbandry and management (Mendes <em>et al. </em>2005a; Pissinatti 2005). Also, some management activities are carried out by researchers in Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo States. A successful translocation was done in Minas Gerais, where an isolated female was translocated to RPPN Mata do Sossego. Since then, this female has produced four cubs; one of them is now a reproductive male.<br/><br/>There is a small but promising captive breeding programme for the Southern species - <em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> (Coimbra- Filho <em>et al.</em> 1993, Pissinatti <em>et al. </em>1998, Pissinatti 2005).<br/><br/>This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Urbani, unpubl. data)). They visit flooded forests when fruit productivity is high (Stevenson <em>et al. </em>2000), and the highest densities seem to be found in places where both terra firme and flooded varzeas co-occur (Ahumada <em>et al.</em> 1998), but it has not been found in the floodplains near the Amazon river.<br/><br/>Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata (Stevenson and Quiñones 1993), and populations in western Amazonia frequently visit specific areas in the forest ground (mineral licks) where they feed of soil (Link <em>et al. </em>2011; Link and Di Fiore 2013). When travelling, they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on ripe and fleshy fruits, which comprise approximately 80% of their diet (Stevenson <em>et al.</em> 2000), consuming preferentially common plants and fruits rich in lipids (Stevenson and Link 2010). They feed mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988, Stevenson and Quiñones 1993, Di Fiore <em>et al. </em>2008). The spider monkeys respond to seasonal periods of fruit scarcity by concentrating at places in the forest with high fruit supply (Mourthé 2014). Additionally, they complement their diet with young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage) (Stevenson<em> et al</em>. 2000, Stevenson 2005), and less often with young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, decaying wood, honey, and very occasionally small insects such as caterpillars (Link 2003, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Mourthé 2012). They play a significant role as seed dispersers, as they swallow seeds from hundreds of species of different trees and lianas (Suarez 2006, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008) and disperse them away from parental sources (Link and Di Fiore 2006). The absence of these primates and other atelines can reduce plant diversity in seedlings and saplings (Stevenson 2011). The population decline of spider monkeys can have negative effects in the forest dynamics in the absence of other large seed dispersers (Pacheco and Simonetti 2000).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 15-55 individuals (for review see Shimooka <em>et al. </em>2008). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groups of varying size and composition (McFarland Symington 1990, Stevenson <em>et al</em>. 1998) that show a high degree of fission fusion dynamics (<em>sensu </em>Aureli <em>et al.</em> 2008). Each female in the group has a core area of the group’s home range which she uses most (Symington 1987, Link and Di Fiore unpubl. data), while males use the group´s home range more evenly. Subgroup size is most frequently of 1 to 4 individuals (Klein and Klein 1976, Link and Di Fiore 2013, Mourthé and Barnett 2014), and only rarely will the entire group coalesce in a single area. Home ranges vary from 150 ha in Tinigua Park, in Colombia and in El Caura basin, in Venezuela, to over 400 ha at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in eastern Ecuador (Castellanos 1997,,Spehar <em>et al.</em> 2010; Link <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Field studies of the behaviour and ecology of this species have been carried out by Izawa <em>et al.</em> (1979), Klein and Klein (1975, 1976, 1977), Ahumada (1989, 1992), Ahumada <em>et al</em>. (1998), Stevenson <em>et al.</em> (1998, 2000), and Link <em>et al. </em>(2006) in La Macarena, Colombia; by Nunes (1988, 1995, 1998),&#160; Mourthé (2011, 2012 2014) and Mourthé and Barnett (2014) at Maracá Ecological Station, Brazil; by Pozo (2001, 2004a, 2004b, 2004c), Suarez (2006), Spehar <em>et al.</em> (2010), Link and Di Fiore (2006), and Di Fiore<em> et al.</em> (2009) in the Yasuní National Park, Ecuador. Additionally, Castellanos (1995, 1997; Castellanos and Chanin 1996) studied the feeding ecology of <em>Ateles belzebuth </em>along the middle and lower reaches of the Río Tawadu, a tributary of the Río Nichare, a tributary of the Rio Caura. Since 2005, Link and Di Fiore (2013 and refs therein) have studied the behavioral ecology and social behavior of white bellied spider monkeys continuously at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station (TBS) in Ecuador.<br/><br/>Six estimated birth dates given by Klein (1971) for <em>A. belzebuth</em>, were spread throughout the year (December, January, April, September, October and November). Nonetheless, in more than 30 births recorded at TBS, Ecuador, births have been restricted to the period between May and December suggesting some reproductive seasonality (Link and Di Fiore unpubl. data). Spider monkeys have been suggested to reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1972) but recent studies have found that females leave their natal groups after 6 years of age and do not give birth until after 2–3 years of being in their new groups. Thus, age at first reproduction for females may well be around 7 to 9 years of age (Link and Di Fiore unpubl. data). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with interbirth cycles that range between 32 and 36 months. Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.<br/><br/><strong>Size</strong><br/>H&amp;B 46-50 cm; TL 74-81 cm (Defler 2003)<br/><br/>Adult male weight mean 8.3 kg (n=10), adult female weight mean 7.9 kg (Smith and Jungers 1997).<br/>Adult male weight 7.3-9.8 kg (mean 8.5 kg, n=12), adult female weight 5.8-10.4 kg (mean 8.1 kg, n=15) (Ford and Davis 1992).","The major threats to <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> are hunting for food, associated live capture for the local pet trade, and habitat loss.<br/><br/>Defler (2003, 2004) considers this species to be among the most endangered of the Colombian Amazonian primates, its range being coincident with the most heavily colonized parts of the region, where its populations are threatened by settlements and commercial development, farming, ranching, timber harvesting, hunting and live capture as pets. In south-central Colombia, particularly in eastern parts of the sub-montane forests and foothills of the Andes, habitat loss is due largely to the expansion of coca plantations (Davalos <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the Peruvian Amazon, the principal threat to <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> in lowland forests is hunting, while montane forest populations are susceptible to ‘accelerated deforestation and the loss of habitats for agriculture, cattle ranching and extraction of forest resources’ (Aquino <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; Surveys conducted at the close of the last century did not encounter this species in large areas of its presumed range, indicating that a number of populations had already been extirpated (Aquino and Encarnación 1994). More recent surveys (Shanee 2012; Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015; Aquino <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2016, 2018) identify the species as one of the most commonly hunted Peruvian primates, its hunting frequently associated with illegal logging activities and resulting in population extirpations, even within private protected areas. The expansion of coca plantations and mining (Bax and Francesconi 2018, Bax <em>et al</em>. 2019) contribute significantly to deforestation and habitat fragmentation within this species’ range. Llactayo <em>et al</em>. (2013a, 2013b) report annual deforestation rates in the states of San Martín and Loreto of 30,000 ha and 35,000 ha, respectively, and report that these are likely to increase.<br/><br/>In Ecuador, this species remains heavily hunted and rare near human settlements (Tirira 2007, Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2018). According to a report of the Ministry of the Environment (2014), the Amazonian provinces where this species occurs have the highest deforestation rates in the country. A study in Yasuní carried out by Suarez <em>et al</em>. (2013) documented a trend of decreasing population density of this species in moderately disturbed areas and its extirpation in highly disturbed areas. In addition, several mining concessions will commence operations within the species’ range in southeastern Ecuador in the near future (S. de la Torre, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Where it occurs in Brazilian Amazonia, <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> is a preferred target for both indigenous and non-indigenous populations (Peres 1990, 2000). Based on surveys of more than 100 sites between 1987 and 2005, in areas where this species&#160; is heavily hunted, population densities are reported to have declined by as much as 50% (Peres and Palacios 2007). Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. (2006) project that close to 100 mammal species in Brazilian Amazonia will lose more than 40% of their tropical forest habitat within protected areas and as much as 80% outside of those areas by the year 2050 due to the expansion of cattle and soy industries, and the construction of all-weather highways into the region’s core. This projection covers a period of approximately 45 years (three spider monkey generations) and is based upon assumptions that the current rates of deforestation and highway construction will continue, compliance with legislation requiring forest reserves on private land will remain low, and new protected areas will not be created. <br/><br/>Of the 28 protected areas located in the five countries in which this species is known or believed to occur, only one has been established within the present century.","In western Amazonia, White-bellied Spider Monkeys have large home ranges (150-400 ha) with only little overlap (20-30%) between them (Klein and Klein 1976, Di Fiore and Campbell 2007, Link and Di Fiore unpubl. data). Given that groups comprise of 20 to 40 individuals, population densities tend to be relatively low. In fact, Derby (2008) estimated population densities for <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> as 6.8 and 7.8 individuals/km²&#160;at Yasuni National Park and Tiputini Biodiversity Station, respectively.<br/><br/>The species is still common within protected areas. Klein and Klein (1976) estimated a population density of 15 to 18 individuals/km² in La Macarena, Colombia and 11.5 individuals/km² in the Parque Nacional Yasuní, in Equador (Dew 2005). In Brazil, population estimates are based on studies carried out at the Estação Ecológica de Maracá, reaching 5.5 to 10 individuals/km² (Mendes Pontes 2004). Nunes<em> et al</em>. (1998) reported 34 individuals/km² based on a small study in a relatively confined area. <em>Ateles</em> population densities in various species and study sites are discussed by McFarland Symington (1988), who concluded that the main factors that determine population densities involve the abundance and productivity of certain key plant resources. Nonetheless, given their large body size, spider monkeys are preferred hunting targets for several indigenous communities (Franzen 2006) and thus populations rapidly decline where hunted. For instance, in the north of Peru Aquino <em>et al. </em>(2013) reported 15.5 to 16.5 individuals/km² in areas with moderate to low hunting pressure, but only 1.5 individuals/km² in areas subjected to high hunting pressure. Population densities in the Reserva Nacional Pacaya Samiria in Peru were also as low with only 1 individual/km² (Aquino and Bodmer 2006).",Decreasing,"The geographic distribution of <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> includes the lowland forests (generally below 1,000 m asl) of western Amazonia in Colombia, Ecuador, and Perú, northern Amazonia in southern Venezuela, and northwestern Brazil, reaching east as far as the Rio Branco. The distribution of this species is not well known, and defies an easy description. There are at least three discontinuous areas of occurrence of White Bellied Spider Monkeys: [1] north-western Amazonian rainforests in Colombia; [2] western Amazonian populations in eastern Ecuador (south of the Río Napo) and northwestern Perú; and [3] those populations living in the easternmost part of the distribution in Venezuela and northwestern Brazil. At least in the last case, such gaps could be partly explained by the occurrence of savannas (a habitat formed by low and sparsely distributed shrubs) that are not used by spider monkeys.<br/><br/>In Colombia, Defler (2003, 2004) reported that the taxon was recorded in the piedmont and Cordillera Oriental as far north as the Río Upía drainage in the department of Boyacá. However, a population was recently discovered west of Yopal, at 1,100 m asl in a forest patch from 1,000 to 1,800 m asl (A. Barrera pers. comm). It occurs in the region of the Sierra de La Macarena, eastern Caquetá and the Coehmaní rapids in the South East of the department of Caquetá. It is rare west of the Río Yarí. It was reported from the upper Río Mesay, opposite of the mouth of the Río Pirá-Paraná on the right bank of the Río Apaporis, and on the lower right bank of the Río Apaporis at a salado (clay-lick) site near the Estrella rapids (Defler 2003, 2004). According to Defler (2003, 2004), there is no evidence for its occurrence between the Ríos Caquetá and Putumayo, except on the most western, upper reaches. <em>Ateles belzebuth </em>extends south along the piedmont into Ecuador, but is evidently absent south of the middle and lower Putumayo (Province of Sucumbíos) and is restricted to the South of Río Napo (De la Torre 2000, Tirira 2007). From there it occurs throughout the Ecuadorian Amazon into northern Peru. The distribution map of Aquino and Encarnación (1994, p.120) shows the occurrence of <em>A. belzebuth</em> throughout northern Peru, between Río Putumayo and Río Amazonas, along the left bank of the Río Ucayali, including the basins of the Ríos Napo, Tigre, Marañón, Pastaza, Pacaya and Samiria, and south as far as the Río Cushabatay, a tributary of the Río Ucayali (with <em>Ateles chamek</em> replacing it south of the Cushabatay). The range in Peru extends through the Putumayo/Napo interfluvium up to the Ecuadorian border, but it seems to end near the mouth of the Río Aguarico, not extending into Ecuador (Tirira 2007). Its occurrence between Putumayo and Amazonas Rivers in Peru would indicate that it occurs in the Colombian Trapezium, but this still warrants confirmation (Defler 2003, 2004). In Brazil, <em>Ateles belzebuth </em>occurs throughout the region north of the Rio Negro and west of the right bank of the Rio Branco in Roraima, extending into Venezuela north towards the Río Orinoco (limited by the llanos/forest interface) and in the East to the left bank of the Río Caura (Bodini and Pérez-Hernández 1987). Although widely distributed in Brazil, the species does not occur continuously, being absent or very rare in large areas of campina and campinarana habitats in the westernmost part of the state of Amazonas and in the savannas in the Northeast of the state of Roraima. It seems there are no known localities which connect the Brazilian/Venezuelan populations with those of south-western Colombia, Ecuador and northern Peru. The occurrence of this species between the Ríos Putumayo and Amazonas-Napo requires further field research. The species has been observed at altitudes up to 1,300 m on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Oriental (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976).",<em>Ateles belzebuth</em> is used as food by humans and as pets.,Terrestrial,"This species is confirmed, or may occur, in a number of  protected areas:<br/><br/>Brazil:<br/><ul><li>Pico da Neblina National Park (2,298,154 ha)</li><li>Maracá Ecological Station (103,995 ha) (Nunes <em>et al</em>. 1988))</li><li>Juamí-Japurá Ecological Station (832,078 ha) (in range)</li><li>Serra da Mocidade National Park (373,130 ha) (in range)</li><li>Niquiá Ecological Station (282,830 ha) (in range)</li><li>Amazonas National Forest (1,573,100 ha) (in range)</li><li>Caracaraí Ecological Station (Ravetta 2008)</li><li>Roraima National Forest (2,664,685 ha) (in range)</li></ul><br/>Colombia:<br/><ul><li>Cordillera de los Picachos Natural National Park (286,600 ha) (Defler 2004)</li><li>La Paya Natural National Park (442,000 ha) (reported by interview Palanco-Ochoa <em>et al.</em> 1999)</li><li>Tinigua Natural National Park (201,875 ha) (Ahumada 1989, 1992; Stevenson <em>et al. </em>2000)</li><li>Serranía de la Macarena Natural National Park (630,000 ha) (Klein and Klein 1976)</li><li>Nukak Natural National Reserve (855,000 ha) (in range: Defler 2004)</li><li>There is potential occurrence of <em>A. belzebuth</em> in the following parks (Defler 2004): </li><li>Puinawai Natural National Reserve (1,092,500 ha)</li><li>Cahuinarí Natural National Park (575,500 ha)</li><li>Serrania de Chiribiquete Natural National Park (1,280,000 ha)</li></ul><br/>Ecuador <br/>Podocarpus National Park (146,280 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/>Sumaco-Napo Galeras National Park (205,249 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/>Yasuní National Park (982,300 ha) (Pozo 2001; Tirira 2007)<br/>Cayambe-Coca Ecological Reserve (403,100 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/>Cofán-Bermejo Ecological Reserve (55,451 ha) (Tirira 2007)<br/><br/>Peru <br/>Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve (2,080,000 ha) (in range: Aquino and Encarnación 1994a).

The forests in the southern part of its range, particularly in the states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso (Brazil), are devastated along the agricultural frontier/arc of deforestation moving from south to north through the Brazilian Amazon. Cattle farming and forest loss are also widespread in northern Bolivia and south-eastern Peru. Major development projects (dams, highways and transmission lines) are potential future threats to the species with strong indications of a continued decline at the same rate over the next three generations. Hunting and deforestation are widespread throughout the southern part of its range, mainly in Brazil.","The species occurs in lowland terra firme unflooded forest, semi-deciduous forest, riparian and flooded forest (várzea and igapó forests) with little or no hunting pressure (van Roosmalen and Klein 1988; Konstant and Rylands 2013). They are also found in transitional forest (forest to savanna) in southwestern Amazonia. In Bolivia, in the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, Wallace <em>et al.</em> (1998) recorded <em>A. chamek</em> most often in tall forest (4.42 encounters per 10 km), followed by so-called saternejal forest (along the forest–savanna border, in the vicinity of small forest streams that undergo periodic flash floods; 2.49 encounters per 10 km). Garcia and Tarifa (1988) found <em>A. chamek</em> to be restricted to high forest in the Beni Biological Station. Otherwise, Alves (2013) recorded<em> A. chamek</em> in both unflooded terra firme and open/dense igapó clear-water flooded forests, but not in cerradão dense savanna woodland. This taxon is restricted to primary forest. The population decline and local extinction of <em>Ateles</em> in most areas with human activity are the result of hunting pressure that is often associated with habitat destruction and degradation (van Roosmalen and Klein 1988; Peres 1997; Parry<em> et al. </em>2007). The species of the genus are present in altered/fragmented areas but generally do not persist for long periods (Peres 1990, 1997). In the state of Rondônia (Brazil), <em>A. chamek</em> occurs in some forest fragments without hunting pressure (Ferrari <em>et al</em>. 1996; Iwanaga and Ferrari 2001, 2002), indicating a relative flexibility of the taxon to habitat disturbances in the absence of hunting.<br/><br/>Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend most time in the upper canopy, sometimes using the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understory. Due to the use of the highest levels of the forest, they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation, arm swinging, and climbing, than walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise about 80-90% of their diet and are found mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). In the state of Rondônia (Brazil), Iwanaga and Ferrari (2001) recorded a diet consisting of 97.1% fruits, of which the Moraceae and Caesalpinaceae families account for 53.3% of the species exploited by <em>A. chamek</em>. Similar findings were presented by Felton <em>et al</em>. (2008) for the Guarayos Forest Reserve in Bolivia, where Moraceae was the most important plant family in the diet, both in terms of number of species and time spent feeding. They also eat young leaves and flowers (especially during periods of fruit shortage at the beginning of the dry season), but occasionally also young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, honey, and at rare occasions small insects such as termites and caterpillars. They play a significant role as seed dispersers. Van Roosmalen (1985) and van Roosmalen and Klein (1988) found that <em>A. paniscus</em> was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species consumed) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). Another 10 species were dispersed by carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory). Only in 23 species the seeds were ruined or digested (seed predation).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in large, territorial, multi-male/multi-female groups of 37-55 individuals (Wallace 2005; Konstant and Rylands 2013). However, they are rarely seen together, and almost always found travelling, feeding and resting in subgroups of varying size and composition (usually 2-4 individuals). The only persistent association is that of a mother and her offspring (McFarland Symington 1990). Iwanaga and Ferrari (2002) recorded a mean (± SE) group size of 3.34 ± 2.60 individuals (n = 219 sightings) at a number of localities in the state of Rondônia in Brazil. At Lago Uauaçú, in the lower Rio Purús region, Haugaasen and Peres (2005) observed a mean groups size of 6.0 individuals/group in terra firme forest, but 12.6 individuals/group in várzea forest. Often single group members travel on their own, and each female occupies a preferred “core area” within the group’s home range. Klein and Klein (1976, 1977) estimated 259-388 ha home ranges with 20-30% overlap between groups for <em>A. belzebuth</em> in La Macarena National Park in Colombia. <em>Ateles</em> species are rarely seen in association with other primates, and if, they are occasional and ephemeral, resulting from the simultaneous occupation of fruiting trees.<br/><br/>Six estimated birth periods, spread throughout the year, were given by Klein (1971) for <em>Ateles belzebuth</em> (i.e., December, January, April, September, October and November). Spider monkeys apparently reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1971; Eisenberg 1973, 1976). They give birth to a single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with a minimum birth interval of 17.5 months (in captivity) or 28-30 months in the wild (Eisenberg 1973, 1976). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for the species to recover from hunting and other threats.","The major threat to the species is subsistence and market hunting (with guns) for food. An additional threat is habitat loss due to agricultural expansion (mainly soya), especially in the southern portion of the species’ range. In other parts, e.g. in the Peruvian Amazon, mining or habitat degradation due to selective logging pose a major threat to the species. The latter affects the key fruiting species and forest structure, but also opens the forest and provides new access for hunters.<br/><br/>In Bolivia, populations of <em>Ateles chamek </em>suffered a serious decline, with local extinctions in many areas (Zanon<em> et al.</em> 2008). In Peru, the taxon is extinct due to hunting in adjacent areas of the Panguana Biological Station, in lower Río Llullapichis and along the Río Pachitea (Freese<em> et al. </em>1982). During surveys of the lower Río Urubamba and in the interfluve between the Ríos Urubamba and Tambo in Peru (which includes areas with high human intervention and hunting pressure), the species was one of the least recorded (Aquino <em>et al.</em> 2013).","<p>The Black-faced Black Spider Monkey is widespread and relatively common where not hunted for its meat (Konstant and Rylands 2013). In Bolivia, <em>Ateles chamek</em> population densities are usually between five and 25 animals/km², reaching a maximum of 80 animals/km² at sites where not hunted (R. Wallace pers. comm). Where densities are highest, its distribution correlates with local habitat heterogeneity, such as areas with adjacent floodplains or terra firme forests (Haugaasen and Peres 2005).  The highest recorded densities for <em>A. chamek</em> were observed in the Manu National Park in Peru, where White (1986) estimated 31 individuals/km², McFarland Symington (1988a) 25-31 individuals/km², and Endo <em>et al</em>. (2010) 14-49 individuals/km². In the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in Bolivia, Wallace <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1998) estimated 32 individuals/km², and in the Guaporé Biological Reserve in Brazil, Alves (2013) estimated 26 individuals/km² in igapó clear-water flooded forest. Factors determining different <em>Ateles</em> population densities in various habitats and study sites are discussed by McFarland Symington (1988b), who concluded that high densities depend on the abundance and productivity of certain key plant resources.</p><p><span lang=""en-US"">In Brazil, Peres (1997) estimated densities of <span lang=""en-US""><em>Ateles chamek</em><span lang=""en-US""> in <span lang=""en-US"">várzea<span lang=""en-US""> <span lang=""en-US"">white-water flooded forests and unflooded forests along the Rio Juruá as reaching 2.6-6.0 individuals/km², while Haugaasen and Peres (2005) in the lower Rio Purús region estimated densities of only 0.3-0.5 individuals/km².</span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""en-US"">Iwanaga and Ferrari (2002) recorded sighting rates averaging 0.69 individuals/10 km (range 0.11-2.40) at 33 survey sites in the state of Rondônia, Brazil.

It crosses the middle Ucayali south of the Río Cushabatay (a left bank tributary of the Ucayali), extending into the interfluvium of the Ríos Ucayali and Huallaga (Konstant and Rylands 2013).

Although they can be found in anthropogenically-disturbed forests, it is suggested that, in general, spider monkeys are highly susceptible to habitat degradation and often fail to persist in smaller forest fragments (Ramos-Fernández and Wallace 2008, and references therein).In general, <em>A. geoffroyi</em> individuals spend a large amount of their time feeding (~33.5-44%), followed by traveling (~32.6-34%), resting (~12-24.1%) and engaged in other activities (~9.8-10%) (Chapman<em> et al</em>. 1989, Chaves <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, they are able to adjust their activity patterns to overcome the effects of food scarcity in forest fragments and seasonality (Chaves <em>et al.</em> 2011).Spider monkey diets are highly biased towards the consumption of fruit, particularly ripe fruits, and for <em>A. geoffroyi</em> the percentage of fruit consumption in their diets has been reported to vary between 55% and 82% (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2008). Other food items include leaves, flowers, invertebrates, etc. and although they obtain water from food items they may also drink water directly from tree holes, bromeliads, streams and other terrestrial water sources (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2008).Spider monkeys live in multi-male/multi-female groups that exhibit a fission–fusion social organization, in which the members of a large stable group separate on a daily basis in small subgroups of changing sizes and composition (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2010). This type of social organization combined with their arboreal habits and fast movements make their observations quite difficult. Only a few studies have been able to quantify the size and composition of <em>A. geoffroyi</em> in the wild, with group sizes varying from 16 to 56 individuals, and a female/male sex ration of 0.8 to to 4.4 (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2010 and references therein). Group home ranges vary greatly between sites from 95 ha in Yucatan, Mexico to 962 ha in Barro Colorado Island, Panama (Wallace 2008).Average weight for adult males is 8.21 kg, ranging from 7.42 to 9 kg, and for females 7.7 kg, ranging from 6 to 9.4 kg (Ford and Davis 1992).Behavioral and ecological field studies have been carried out mostly in Costa Rica and Panama (see recent reviews on different aspects of their behavior in Campbell 2008).","The major threats to this species are intense habitat loss, habitat degradation due to selective logging of trees of important dietary value, and overexploitation for pet trade (Estrada<em> et al.</em> 2006, Ramos-Fernandez and Wallace 2008). Given the relatively late sexual maturation, single births and long interbirth intervals of spider monkeys, threats to the habitat or directly to the monkey populations produce a stronger negative impact to the overall survival of wild populations (Ramos-Fernandez and Wallace 2008).","Population density of <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> varies considerably among populations and across its distribution range. In Mexico (Chiapas, Campeche and Quintana Roo) reported densities vary between 6.3 and 89.5 ind./km², in Guatemala from 28 to 56.4 ind./km<sup>2</sup>, in Panama 2.1 to 2.3 ind./km<sup>2</sup> (Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2010). For Costa Rica densities of 68.5 ind./km² were reported in Corcovado National Park by Weghorst (2007).<br/><br/>A population reduction of greater than 50% is suspected over the course of 45 years (three generations), including the current (2018-2033) and two subsequent generations (2033-2063).&#160;This is based upon Global Forest Watch data for regions of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia in which the species currently occurs.&#160; The data suggests that, should forest loss continue at the same rate that has impacted the previous generation (2004-2018), more than a third (34%) of this species’ forest habitat is likely to be lost by the year 2063. Combined with even light hunting for bushmeat and the pet trade, to which this large-bodied primate is particularly susceptible, these threats push&#160;<em>Ateles geoffroyi&#160;</em>above the threshold for Endangered.",Decreasing,"<em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> occurs in the Mexican sates of Veracruz, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Chiapas, Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo, extending south to Guatemala and Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. There are six recognized subspecies: <em>A. g. geoffroyi</em>, <em>A. g. azuerensis</em>, <em>A. g. frontatus</em>, <em>A. g. grisescens</em>, <em>A. g. ornatus</em> and <em>A. g. vellerosus</em>.<br/><br/>According to Kellogg and Goldman (1944) <em>Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi</em> is distributed in the coastal region around San Juan del Norte or Martina Bay in southeastern Nicaragua, extending across the lowlands to the vicinity of Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua on the Pacific coast. It possibly extends into northern Costa Rica, although the true distribution of this species is unknown. Specimens examined by Kellogg and Goldman (1944) were from Managua, Nicaragua.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi azuerensis</em> occurs only in the forested mountains of the Azuero peninsula. Mendez-Carvajal (2013) surveyed the area and reported <em>A. g. azuerensis</em> remaining in the wild in the provinces of Veraguas and Los Santos, but already extinct in the province of Herrera.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi frontatus</em> is believed to range through northwestern Costa Rica and extreme western and northern Nicaragua (Kellogg and Goldman 1944). Specimens from Nicaragua examined by Kellogg and Goldman (1944) were from the following localities: Lavala; Peña Blanca; Río Siquia; Río Yoya, a tributary of the Río Princapolca; Tuma and Uluce. Allen (1908, 1910) recorded <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> from the east slope of the Nicaraguan highlands, Savala (800 ft), Tuma (1,000 ft), Peña Blanca (high point in low Atlantic coast forests, 1,500 ft) and Uluce (about 1,000 ft), and in the highlands of northern Nicaragua at Matagalpa (2,000 ft). Morales-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> (2015) reported that individuals from Santa Rosa, Costa Rica and those from central and eastern Nicaragua form a monophyletic clade, corresponding to this subspecies. It is possible that individuals from El Salvador also belong to this subspecies, or to a distinct and previously unidentified subspecies (Morales-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. (2015).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi grisescens</em> is a subspecies of doubtful validity. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) presumed that it occurred in the valley of the Río Tuyra extending south-east through the Serranía del Sapo of extreme south-eastern Panama and the Cordillera de Baudó of north-western Colombia. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) indicated that grisescens occurs in Colombia: “…[it] is known only from the vicinity of Juradó very near the Panamanian border on the Pacific coast. It is undoubtedly restricted by the Baudó Mountains to a narrow coastal strip that may extend as far south as Cabo Corrientes.” (p.66), but Defler <em>et al</em>. (2003) mentioned that there are no observations to confirm its presence in Colombia.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi ornatus</em> is found in Panama, to the east of the Canal Zone, and to the west through the Chiriquí province to central/western Costa Rica. Heltne and Kunkel (1975) proposed that the eastern limits of this subspecies were in San Juan, Cerro Brujo, Cerro Azul and Río Pequeñi — all within the Madden Lake watershed, about 30 miles east of the Panama Canal. The limits of this subspecies in Costa Rica are not well known, but it is believed that this species occurs in the Osa Peninsula, Corcovado National Park and Carara Biological Reserve (Matamoros and Seal 2001). The population on Barro Colorado Island was introduced in the 1950s and 1960s, and it is unknown whether they belonged to a single subspecies (see Milton and Hopkins 2006).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Ateles geoffroyi vellerosus </em>occurs in southern Veracruz, eastern Oaxaca, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan, and Qunitana Roo in Mexico, and to the south through Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Originally, Kellogg and Goldman (1944) considered <em>A. g. pan</em> and <em>A. g. yucatanensis</em> as distinct taxa, but morphological analyses by Silva-López <em>et al</em>. (1996) and recent molecular work by Morales-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. (2015) show that individuals within this range belong to a single (though morphologically variable) taxon.","Being one of the largest Neotropical primates, <em>Ateles </em>is commonly hunted as a source of food by local people (e.g., Peres 1990; Ramos-Fernandez &amp; Wallace 2008; Shanee <em>et al.</em> 2017). However, reports on <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> currently hunted for that purpose are scarce, as it seems to only occur occasionally in Mesoamerica (Carrillo <em>et al.</em> 2000). However, <em>Ateles </em>heavily trafficked for pet trade. Duarte-Quiroga and Estrada (2003) reported spider monkeys as the most common primate pet in Mexico City accounting for 67% (out of the 179 cases reported). Although it is common to find spider monkeys as pets in Mesoamerica there is no accurate information on the extent of the pet trade.",Terrestrial,"Despite of intense deforestation observed in Mesoamerica, with more than 70% of the original forest cover lost as a result of human activity (Estrada <em>et al</em>. 2006), the region counts with over 400 officially recognized protected areas within the distribution range of <em>Ateles geoffroyi</em>. However, many of these areas suffer several problems including lack of actual protection, limited number of staff, small size, poor delimitation, and isolation due to high deforestation rates in surrounding areas (Estrada <em>et al.</em> 2006). Among the largest extensions of protected forest where <em>A. geoffroyi </em>lives are the Mayan Forest, located on the borders of Mexico, Guatemala and Belize, La Mosquitia, which is located in both Honduras and Nicaragua, the Indio Maiz-Tortuguero, which includes a group of reserves and indigenous territories in Nicaragua and Tortuguero National Park in Costa Rica, and La Amistad International Park, a World Heritage Site located along the Talamanca mountain range of Costa Rica and Panama.<br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II (except for <em>A. g. frontatus</em> and <em>A. g. ornatus</em>, which are listed on Appendix I).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

In Colombia <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> inhabits dry forest, humid forest and cloud forest, occupying the greatest range of forest habitats of any of the Colombian spider monkeys (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976).&#160; Defler (2004) indicated that they range as high as 2,000-2,500 m Asl in the Cordilllera Occidental. In Panama, <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> is reported between 200-1,350 m Asl in pre-montane and montane forest, but have been also reported in lowland tropical rainforest, persisting in agricultural mosaics using only living fences or gallery forest (Méndez-Carvajal 2012). <br/>The presence of <em>A. f. fusciceps </em>in a locality could be correlated with suitable habitat conditions such as continuous canopy cover and high abundance of large and tall trees (Gavilánez-Endara 2006; Estévez-Noboa 2009; Cueva and Pozo 2010; Moscoso 2010). These conditions are found mostly in mature and undisturbed forest. Nevertheless, this species has been recorded in old secondary forest, connected with continuous forest patches.&#160; Occupancy modelling of the subspecies in a lowland evergreen forests (Tesoro Escondido) suggest that with enough primary forest it may be able to persist in a mosaic habitat (Spaan 2013). Altitude could be associated with low abundance of the subspecies (Madden y Albuja 1989; Shanee 2009; Moscoso 2010), therefore well preserved lowland forest harbors the healthiest populations of <em>A. f. fusciceps. &#160;</em><br/><br/>Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understory. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, brachiating, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988; Tirira <em>et al.</em> 2014). They play a significant role as seed dispersers. Van Roosmalen (1985; Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that <em>A. paniscus</em> was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory). In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation). A study of diet of one individual <em>A. fusciceps fusciceps </em>living with a group of <em>Alouatta palliata </em>in a patch of forest in Ecuador (Moscoso 2010), revealed a high rate of ingestion of young leaves during the dry season (63%), followed by fruits (25% ), flowers (8%) and others (5%); while during the wet season fruits were the main item consumed (47%), followed by young leaves (42%) and others (11%).&#160; Tapia (2013) reported that the fruits of Brosimum utile are the preferred item selected by <em>A. f. fusciceps</em> in Tesoro Escondido (Esmeraldas Province), followed by the fruits of <em>Inga</em> spp. and <em>Pouroma chocoana. </em>","<p> <em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em><br/>Tirira <em>et al.</em> (2011) identified this subspecies as the most endangered primate in Ecuador and estimated a reduction of greater than 80% in population size based on habitat loss. This species has a very small distribution, is highly fragmented, and is under pressure from high rates of habitat loss due to deforestation and strong hunting pressure.<br/> <br/> <em>Ateles fusciceps rufiventris<br/></em> In Colombia all spider monkeys are considered threatened due to hunting, habitat loss and fragmentation (Defler <em>et al.</em> 2003). National Parks such as Katios and Orquideas are believed to have very few spider monkeys because of indigenous hunting pressure (N. Vargas pers. comm.; H. Rubio pers. comm.) and the population density of <em>Ateles</em> may be decreasing in Los Katios (Director del Parque Los Katios, D. Pintor pers. comm.). Widespread censuses of <em>Ateles</em> are needed, especially in national parks.<br/> <br/>In Colombia, along the Caribbean coast, it has been estimated that over 30% of habitat has been lost in the past 10 years based on calculations from satellite photos (Miller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Ground truthing of this data found only 2.5% of viable secondary forest habitat was left in this region (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Panama, there is a lower human population and likely higher habitat availability, but more research is needed to determine population status and threats to this subspecies.</p> <p>In Panama, <em>A.f. rufiventris</em> is considered Critically Endangered due to deforestation and heavy hunting activity as indigenous people from the Embera-Wounaan ethnic group use them as a cultural protein resource. Among the environmental problems that Darien Province currently faces are high and uncontrolled deforestation. The Chucantí Nature Reserve is one of the few areas in the Darien Province that are now protected by the land owner (Méndez-Carvajal, 2012).&#160;</p>","<em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em> is rare and difficult to see (Madden and Albuja 1989). Recent population density estimates in Ecuador within the buffer areas of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the Awa Ethnic Reserve report are 0.2–8.5 individuals/km² (Gavilánez-Endara 2006, Baird 2007, Cueva 2008, Estévez-Noboa 2009, Moscoso 2010). The size of the subgroups varies from 1-10 individuals (Gavilánez-Endara 2006, Cueva 2008, Estévez-Noboa 2009, Moscoso 2010). No subpopulation larger than 50 individuals has been found. Further population decline in the future is probable due to deforestation, fragmentation and hunting pressure. Nevertheless, some localities, such as Playa de Oro (in Esmeraldas Province), where conditions have improved (e.g. hunting has stopped), populations of this subspecies are recovering (Moscoso 2010). There is possibly one main area that is harbouring the greatest subpopulations of <em>A. f. fusciceps</em> in Ecuador: the buffer area of the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve, especially the unprotected Canandé basin (Moscoso 2010, Peck <em>et al.</em> 2011). Other important subpopulations in the north of Ecuador are the Awa Ethnic and Forest Reserve and the Awacachi Ecological Corridor (which connects both reserves). It is inferred from past records and recent reports of one individual (Tirira 2008, Moscoso 2010, S. Shanee (unpublished data)), that a subpopulation exists within the northwest of Pichincha Province, but this subpopulation is almost isolated from the others. There is one recent record suggesting a possible relict population in Flavio Alfaro (Manabí Province) (Cervera and Griffith submitted).<em><br/><br/>Ateles fusciceps rufiventris</em> is distributed in a wide area of the Colombian Chocó region. However, it is extremely difficult to find in these forests, probably due to the low population densities that are a result, in part, of pervasive subsistence hunting. Some recent records include a large group observed in Montes de Maria, Bolivar, a population living in the Private Reserve Tití Cabeciblanco from Fundación Proaves, and other scant records in the Colombian Chocó. Some sporadic records have been registered in the adjacent areas near Parque Nacional Tamá, at about 1,800 m asl. The first population survey for this species in Panama was conducted by the Fundación Pro-Conservación de los Primates Panameños (FCPP), estimating about 60 individuals of <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> living in two groups with average of 20 individuals/group and 1-13 per subgroups, population density of 9.3 ind/km² at Chucanti Nature Reserve within 3.5 km² of montane and pre-montane forest reaching 1,350 m asl (Méndez-Carvajal, 2012).<br/><br/>Global Forest Watch data for the regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Panama in  which the species currently occurs suggest that, should  forest loss continue at the same rate that it has since 2004, close to 20% of this monkey's forest habitat is  likely to be lost by the year 2063. This, combined with hunting for bushmeat  and the pet trade, to which this large-bodied primate is particularly  susceptible, is driving population declines for <em>Ateles fusciceps</em>. It is suspected that these threats will cause a population reduction of at least 50% over three generations (2018-2063).",Decreasing,"<p> There are two recognized subspecies:<br/><br/><em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em> is endemic to northwestern Ecuador from Esmeraldas Province (west of the Andes Mountain Range) to the northwest of Pichincha and Santo Domingo Provinces, extending to the western borders of Imbabura and Carchi Provinces.  There are past reports of this species in the south, within the Colon Colonche Mountain Range (within Manabí, Guayas and Santa Elena Provinces), and westward on Chimborazo Province. A recent report of this subspecies has been made in the northwest of Manabí Province (Flavio Alfaro). Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) suggested that <em>A. f. fusciceps</em> might occur in southern Colombia, south of the Río Mira, continuous with the populations in Ecuador, but no evidence has been forthcoming regarding this.</p> <p> <em>Ateles fusciceps rufiventris </em>does not occur in Ecuador and is discontinuous with <em>A. f. fusciceps</em>. <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> ranges from the western cordillera of the Andes from south-western Colombia, northward on west side of the Río Cauca to eastern Panama (Cerro Pirre and the basin of the Río Bayano of the Pacific coast) (Rylands <em>et al.</em> 2006). The Cerro Pirre or the Río Tucutí mark the border with <em>A. geoffroyi grisescens</em>. In Colombia, <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> occurs throughout the Pacific lowlands except for Juradó in the north-western part of the Department of Chocó, supposedly the domain of A. g. grisescens (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler, 2003, 2004). It occurs in the Urabá region in north-western Antioquia, Córdoba, Sucre, and northern Bolívar east to the lower Río Cauca along the western bank to south-central Antioquia. The most southerly record in Colombia is Barabacoas, Department of Nariño, and the most northerly is the southern bank of the Canal del Dique, Cartagena. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) believed that it formerly occurred as far north as Pendales.  Although the historical distribution of <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> comprises large areas in the Colombian Chocó, many of these areas have been largely defaunated and only a few recent records of the species have been registered in the last decade, specifically in Montes de Maria, Bolivar, at Mutatá, Chonó and near Guapi. <br/><br/>In Panama, <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> occurs in Maje Mountain Chain, Darien National Park (Pirre, Boca de Cupe), Chucanti Nature Reserve, only for Darien and Panama provinces (Méndez-Carvajal, 2012; 2014).</p>",It is used as food by humans.,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is included in CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/>In Ecuador, <em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em> has been considered Critically Endangered in the Red Book of Mammals of Ecuador since 2001 (Tirira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011) and included in the List of the World’s 25 Most Threatened Primate Species (2012-2014) (Tirira <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It is protected in accordance with Resolution No. 143 of the Ministry of the Environment (<em>Registro Oficial</em> No. 6 of 23 January 2003) (Tirira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), prohibiting hunting and commercialization throughout Ecuador for an indefinite period.<br/><br/>All studies conducted up to now on <em>A.f. fusciceps</em> recommend conservation actions focusing on unprotected lowland forest to the south and west of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, where population densities are greatest, the habitat conditions are good and hunting pressure is low (Moscoso 2010; Peck <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011; Tirira, <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). If this area is protected, it could become a core area of healthy groups of the subspecies, capable of sustaining itself and become a source of genetic flow with individuals of other subpopulations in the north and south of the country. Some initiatives focused on research and conservation of the subspecies have been developed in Ecuador since 2005, firstly through PRIMENET (sustainable&#160;network&#160;for conservation of primates and habitat in NW Ecuador), and through ongoing projects of Proyecto Washu and the University of Sussex (since 2012).

In Suriname, <em>A. paniscus</em> is almost entirely restricted to high forests in the interior, and, like <em>Chiropotes</em> and <em>Cebus olivaceus</em>, it enters the old coastal plain only in the western part of the country. Although Sanderson (1949) mentioned that <em>Ateles</em> is met with ""over certain good areas along a belt 8-15 miles from the coast"", this is evidently not the case today. In Guyana, it is also restricted in its habitat, occurring mainly in high forest (Muckenhirn <em>et al</em>. 1975, Sussman and Phillips-Conroy 1995). In Suriname, it rarely enters river edge forest, but Muckenhirn <em>et al.</em> (1975) made several observations of <em>A. paniscus</em> while surveying by canoe along the Berbice River. Van Roosmalen (1980, 1985) argued that this may due to differences in hunting pressure between the areas. To what degree <em>A. paniscus</em> extends to the coastal region of French Guiana is unknown. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) listed three localities for French Guiana: the Camopi River, and two on the coast, Cayenne and the Lunier River. Due to forest destruction and development, the high forest preference of the species, and its susceptibility to hunting, it is reasonable to suppose that if it occurred there in the past it is rare or absent today through large parts at least of the coastal forests. In Brazil, it occurs in lowland, submontane and montane (Serra da Pacaraima) forest.<br/><br/><em>Ateles paniscus</em> is very much a canopy species. Nearly three-quarters of all first sightings of <em>A. paniscus</em> during a three-year field study carried out by Marc van Roosmalen (1980, 1985) in the Voltzberg-Raleighvallen Nature Reserve were of animals in the emergent trees (above 30 m) or upper part of the canopy (25-30 m). They also enter the middle and lower parts of the canopy, but were very rarely seen in the understorey. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours (Fleagle and Mittermeier 1980). <em>Ateles paniscus</em>, like all spider monkeys, is highly frugivorous and feeds largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly (77% of its feeding time) in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (van Roosmalen 1980, 1985; Zhang and Wang 1995a). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), and besides such as young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars. Guillotin <em>et al.</em> (1993) and Simmen and Sabatier (1996) obtained a similar picture for <em>A. paniscus</em> in French Guiana. The pulp of ripe fruits accounted for 85% of their diet. They also recorded the occasional consumption of fungi and mature seeds. Many even quite large fruits are swallowed whole. Swallowing the entire fruit is characteristic of nearly 40% of the fruit species they eat, and in a further 45% of the fruits they bite off the outer layer and swallow the aril or mesocarp along with the seed or seeds.<br/><br/>Due to their specialization on ripe fruits, and the fact that they tend to swallow whole fruits and intact seeds, <em>Ateles</em> are very important seed dispersers for many trees and lianes. Van Roosmalen (1980, 1985; van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that <em>A. paniscus</em> was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory).  In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 20-30 individuals (for review see van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groupings of varying size and composition, the only persistent association being that of a mother and her offspring (McFarland Symington 1990). Group members will also travel on their own. Each female in the group has a “core area” of the group’s home range which she uses most. In Guyana, Muckenhirn <em>et al</em>. (1975) reported an average sub-group size of 2.4 individuals. In Suriname, Van Roosmalen’s (1980, 1985) study group consisted of 18 animals (three adult males, eight adult females, one subadult female, four juveniles and two infants), but the largest subgroup he observed was of nine individuals.<br/><br/>Only van Roosmalen’s (1980, 1985) study has provided an estimate of the home range size for <em>A. paniscus</em>.  His study group covered approximately 255 ha (220 ha with suitable habitat), most of it in high forest and a small portion in high mountain savanna forest. He believes that they maintain discrete, non-overlapping ranges with clearly-defined borders defended by the males, although only a single intergroup encounter was observed at one of these borders. Home range sizes may be bigger in other areas, depending on the distribution and year-round availability of food sources. Within their ranges, subgroups may travel distances from 500 to 5,000 m a day, depending on subgroup size and composition, weather, season, and the distribution of their current food sources (van Roosmalen 1980, 1985). During the dry season, they tend to travel less, especially when leaves have become a more significant component of their diet. Their day typically has two resting periods, one between 08h00 and 10h00 hours, and the other between 12h00 and 14h30. They spend more time resting during the dry season when fruit is scarce. Feeding activity is highest for the first two hours of the morning, and likewise the last two hours before entering their sleeping trees. Van Roosmalen (1980, 1985) recorded 43 different sleeping trees over the three years of his study, but just a few of them were frequently used. They are always tall, emergent trees, well free of the canopy, with a broad, open crown, either small-leaved, leafless or in leaf flush, horizontally branched, and located strategically near the next days feeding site, or better still are the next days feeding site.<br/><br/><em>Ateles</em> are rarely seen in association with other primates and mostly they are occasional and ephemeral, resulting from the simultaneous occupation of fruiting trees. <br/><br/>Although Husson (1957) mentions seeing young animals throughout the year, <em>Ateles</em> have a clearly defined birth season in Suriname. Newborn infants are seen only in November, December and January, indicating that they are born at the end of the long dry season and during the short wet season. However, the few data available from other areas indicate the a lack of a breeding season. Six estimated birth dates given by Klein (1971) for <em>A. belzebuth</em> were spread throughout the year (December, January, April, September, October and November). Spider monkeys apparently reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1972; Eisenberg 1973, 1976). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with a minimum theoretical interbirth interval in captivity of 17.5 months, but in the wild probably as long as 28-30 months (Eisenberg 1973, 1976). However, for <em>A. paniscus</em>, van Roosmalen (1980) estimated an interbirth interval of 46-50 months for females successfully rearing their young. They show lactational anoestrus for about three years. When in oestrus, females tend to manipulate, inspect and rub their clitoris. Sexual receptivity lasts 8-10 days, with an interestrus of 15-17 days (van Roosmalen 1980). Copulation is generally preceded by much place sniffing and urine licking on the part of the male, who consorts the female during her oestrus, although van Roosmalen (1980) observed that receptive females appeared to choose their mate. It is the receptive female which initiates sexual activity by rushing towards a male and sitting in his lap. If he does not respond she leaves and then returns to repeat the action some minutes later. Behaviour prior to copulation resembles play, involving head-shaking, heavy panting, and even growling and wrestling. Copulation takes place with both monkeys sitting, the male behind the female, grasping the female around her chest and with his legs over and between the females thighs (van Roosmalen 1980). The female copulates three or four times a day during oestrus.<br/><br/>When two individuals meet after a period of separation, they may show a ritualized form of greeting behaviour that includes embracing and pectoral (chest) sniffing (<em>Ateles</em> have olfactory skin glands in this region, but in the wild at least they have never been observed to rub them on branches as has been seen for <em>A. belzebuth</em> for example). Each put their arms around each other and their nose to the others chest which they may lick or sniff. In <em>A. paniscus</em> this may be accompanied by grunting vocalizations, and the embrace is usually initiated by the lower ranking animal of the two (van Roosmalen 1980). It is often followed by genital sniffing. Klein (1971) suggested that the hypertrophied clitoris is for depositing drops of urine as scent marks, and rubbing of the anogenital region also undoubtedly serves in olfactory communication. Communicative tactile signals include also grooming, and wrapping the tail and limbs around other individuals, which often follows embraces. Other behaviours shown in varying contexts, many of them aggressive or agonistic, include head-shaking, chest-scratching, pilo-erection, hopping and bounding, vigorous arm swaying, and branch shaking and dropping, and, when highly aroused, defecation. In agonistic displays the tail may be held up and curled at the tip. Detailed studies of their behaviours and their possible social meanings are described in Eisenberg (1976: see also van Roosmalen and Klein 1988).<br/><br/>Size: <br/>Three males in the British Museum had a mean H&amp;B length of 545 mm (range: 515-580) and a mean TL of 807 mm (range: 720-852); 10 females had a mean H&amp;B length of 540 mm (range: 490-620) and a mean TL of 814 mm (range: 640-930) (Napier 1976). Four females cited in Kellogg and Goldman (1944) had the following measurements: H&amp;B length: 460, 418, 570 and 660; TL 870, 920, 880 and 753. Male <em>A. paniscus</em> are more robust and larger than females. There has been some controversy concerning the possibility that the reverse is true (Ford and Davis 1992, Peres 1994), but a review by Smith (1996) specifically examining this problem points out this supposition was based on statistical error. Body mass for <em>A. paniscus </em> is estimated at 9.11 kg for males and 8.44 kg for females (Mittermeier 1977, Ayres 1986, Smith 1996).","<em>Ateles paniscus</em> is threatened due to habitat loss caused by expanding agriculture, ranching, mining, hydroelectric and associated road construction, which contributes to heavy hunting pressure.<br/><br/>Approximately 60% of this species’ range lies within the Amazonian lowlands of Brazil, the balance in the highlands of Guyana, French Guiana and Suriname. <em>Ateles paniscus </em>occurs in more than a dozen protected areas in Brazil (160,684 km²; 74%), three in French Guiana (34,768 km²; 16%), four in Suriname (17,144 km²; 8%), and two in Guyana (3,757 km²; 2%). This species’ range includes roughly one million km² (20%) of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia, of which only about 20% is included in officially protected areas.<br/><br/>According to a study by Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. (2006), Atelidae of Brazilian Amazonia may lose 40% or more of their tropical forest habitat outside of protected areas by the year 2050 under one of two scenarios – ‘business as usual’ or ‘governance’. In the case of <em>A. paniscus</em>, three new protected areas (close to 90,000 km²) have been added within the species’ range since 2003, which suggests that its status should be determined based on the ‘governance scenario’; the anticipated loss of suitable forest habitat by the year 2050 would be 40% or more. However, the loss could be greater based on legal threats to existing protected areas such as downgrading or de-gazettement (Biedzicki de Marques and Peres 2014).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is compounded by hunting. Based on surveys of mid-sized to large Neotropical forest vertebrate species at more than 100 sites, Peres and Palacios (2007) predict that Amazonian <em>Ateles</em> are likely to experience declines in population density of as much as 75% in areas of light hunting and upwards of 90% in heavily hunted areas. Should hunting in Brazilian Amazonia continue apace with plans for road construction and increase on indigenous lands as government protection policies are relaxed, a corresponding decline in <em>Ateles paniscus</em> populations can be anticipated.","In the Voltzberg Study Area, spider monkeys were found to occur at a density of approximately 8.2 individuals/km² (Mittermeier and Van Roosmalen 1981). At Nourague, French Guiana, Guillotin <em>et al</em>. (1993) estimated a density of 14.0 individuals/km², with a biomass of 132.3 kg/km², the second highest in the primate community after the howling monkeys (144.6 kg/km²). Kessler (1998) estimated a slightly lower density in Nouragues: 7-10 individuals/km². Figures from other areas are usually in the same range. Muckenhirn <em>et al.</em> (1975) estimated lower densities of 2.4-6.2/km² for three areas in Guyana. Factors determining different <em>Ateles</em> population densities in various species and study sites are discussed by McFarland Symington (1988), who concluded that the main factors involve the abundance and productivity of certain key plant resources. Hunting  is a major factor affecting primate population densities in French Guiana (Roussilhon 1988).",Decreasing,"<em>Ateles pansicus</em> occurs north of the Rio Amazon, east of the Rios Negro and Branco. In Guyana, it is known from the far south and from the east of the River Essequibo (Sussmann and Phillips-Conroy 1995), and east from there through Suriname and French Guiana, excluding the lowland coastal plains, but throughout adequate habitat and into the states of Amapá, Pará (north of the Rio Amazonas), and Amazonas, Brazil.

They spend most of their time in the canopy, sometimes use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understory. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on ripe fleshy fruits, which comprise approximately 80% of their diet and that are mainly found in the emergent trees and upper parts of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Link <em>et al.</em> 2012). They complement their diet with young leaves and flowers (especially at times of fruit shortage), with immature seeds, floral buds, aerial roots, and decaying wood (Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008). They play a significant role as seed dispersers as they disperse large quantities of seeds from numerous canopy tree and liana species (van Roosmalen 1985, Link and Di Fiore 2006). Studies on brown spider monkeys at Las Quinchas revealed that they largely depend on ripe fruits, spending over 90% of their foraging time feeding on them (Link <em>et al.</em> 2012). Nonetheless, some populations living in fragmented areas include large quantities of young leaves in their diet (app. 40%) all year-round (Link <em>et al.</em> unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in multi-male/multi-female groups of approximately 30 individuals (range 15–60) (for review see Shimooka <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, they are rarely seen all together and are most of the time travelling, feeding and resting in small groups of varying size and composition (Symington 1990). Thus, spider monkeys have a high degree of fission fusion dynamic (Aureli <em>et al.</em> 2008). Although, spider monkeys can have home ranges as large as 400 ha (Link and Di Fiore 2013), home ranges of brown spider monkeys, in the heavily fragmented landscape at San Juan de Carare, were estimated to reach only 30-120 ha. Most probably, home ranges of groups living in continuous forests will be larger. <br/><br/> Although some populations of spider monkeys seem to have most of their births in certain months of the year (May–December for white-bellied spider monkeys at TBS, Ecuador), there is no information on birth seasonality for brown spider monkeys. Female spider monkeys disperse from their natal groups (Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2009) at approximately 6 years and reach sexual maturity at approximately 8–9 years of age. They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with average inter-birth intervals of 32-36 months.<br/><br/>Congdon (1996) provided a brief remark on the behaviour of these monkeys at the Reserva Forestal Caparo, and Duque (2007) provided a list of potential feeding trees for <em>Ateles hybridus hybridus</em> in the El Ávila National Park (however, this primate species was not observed at the time of Duque´s survey). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.<br/> <br/> Size<br/> Adult male weight: 6.5-8.5 kg (mean 7.5 kg, N=3) (Link unpubl. data)<br/> Adult female weight: not available.</p>","In Colombia and Venezuela, <em>Ateles hybridus </em>is subject to pervasive habitat loss and to hunting (Link <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Colombia the habitat of <em>A. hybridus </em>is extremely fragmented, and currently less than 20% of the historical distribution remains (Link <em>et al.</em> 2013). There may be a few populations of adequate size to be viable in the mid- to long-term (Defler <em>et al.</em> 2003). Large and continuous forests only remain at Serranía de San Lucas, Serranía del Perijá, Catatumbo and Serranía de Las Quinchas, but a large proportion of forest fragments within their range is too small to hold viable populations. Also, in areas with large continuous forests, brown spider monkeys are heavily hunted for subsistence and for medicinal use, driving their populations to local extinction.<br/><br/>Habitat alteration appears to be the most important threat to the Venezuelan population of <em>A. hybridus</em>. The lowland forest of the state of Zulia and the piedmont of the Perijá Mountains are heavily destroyed by expanding cattle ranching activities (B. Urbani unpubl. data). Portillo and Velásquez (2006) undertook a gap analysis for this primate species within the Perijá Mountains and found that the remaining total forest area is still sufficiently large (813,257 ha), but only 30% is relatively well protected. The rest is affected by rapid human expansion and land clearance. Also, in the Perijá Mountains, these monkeys seem to be a favourite game species (Lizarralde 2002). In central Venezuela, some areas that were reported to harbour these primates (Cordero-Rodríguez and Biord 2001) were resurveyed by Duque (2007) without reporting any sightings. This is probably because most of the area is already converted into secondary vegetation. Also in this region, B. Urbani (unpubl. data) found that buffer areas around the protected areas—with confirmed populations of <em>Ateles hybridus hybridus</em> (P. N. Guatopo) and unconfirmed populations (M. N. Cueva Alfredo Jahn, P. N. Henry Pittier, P. N. San Esteban and P. N. El Ávila)—are transformed into cleared areas for slash-and-burn agriculture, human settlements or secondary forests. The lowland forests in the eastern part of the Andean Mountains (San Camilo and Ticoporo) are under severe pressure from logging.","<p>In Colombia, the early studies of Bernstein <em>et al.</em> (1976a) estimated a density of 9-14 individuals/km² for <em>Ateles hybridus</em> in the northern range of the San Lucas Mountains. In the same region, specifically at Cerro Bran, Green (1978) estimated densities of 8.2-9.6 groups/km², which, if multiplied by his average group size (3.3 individuals), provide higher population densities. Since 2007 several studies were conducted aiming to estimate population densities of brown spider monkeys in the wild (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). Population densities vary from absent to 67 individuals/km².<br/><br/>A population reduction of 80% or more over a period of 45 years or three generations is suspected for the current generation (2018-2033) and two subsequent generations (2033-2063). This reduction will likely be due in part to the loss of suitable habitat, calculated from Global Forest Watch data to be between 20-30% in those regions of Colombia and Venezuela in which this species occurs.&#160; In addition, and perhaps more importantly, this species is very heavily hunted for its meat, as well as for the pet trade. According to studies done by Peres and Palacios (2007), population densities of heavily-hunted&#160;<em>Ateles</em>&#160;species can decline by as much as 80% or more over several generations.</p>",Decreasing,"<p> Brown spider monkeys (<em>Ateles hybridus</em>) are found in the middle Magdalena River basin, in north-eastern Colombia, in the Perijá Mountains, in the south-eastern areas of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and across the Andes into western Venezuela. An isolated population occurs in north-eastern Venezuela in the Parque Nacional Guatopo. <br/><br/><span lang=""en-US"">In Colombia, wild populations are found on the western bank of the Magdalena River in the departments of Bolívar, Antioquia and Caldas, with most populations living in lowland forests (below 1,000 m asl.), but some recent records were reported from higher altitudes (1,780 m asl, Roncancio-Duque 2012). They are also found on the eastern bank of the Magdalena River in the departments of Magdalena and César (north of the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta), in the south-western parts of Guajira on the western and eastern slopes of the Serranía de Perijá, and in the middle Río Magdalena valley reaching the departments of Boyacá and Cundinamarca. West of the eastern Andes they are found in the Río Catatumbo watershed in the department of Norte de Santander and in the north-east piedmont forest of the department of Arauca (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler 2003, 2004). Brown spider monkeys have a disrupted distribution in Venezuela (Mondolfi and Eisenberg 1979). They are found in the north, along the south-eastern part of the Central Mountain Range (Cordillera de la Costa) in the state of Miranda, and probably in the state of Vargas.

Urbani, unpubl. data).</span><br/><br/>Global Forest Watch data show that forest loss rates are between 20-30% in those regions of Colombia and Venezuela in which this species occurs (Global Forest Watch 2020).</p>",This species is hunted for subsistence and for medicinal use.,Terrestrial,"Although <em>Ateles hybridus</em> is found in several protected areas in Colombia, there is no information on the status of these protected populations. It is found at:&#160;[1] Catatumbo-Bari National Natural Reserve (158,125 ha): there might be a large population (given the forest cover and habitat types protected within the National Park), but there is almost no information on their population size.&#160;[2] Tamá National Natural Park (48,000 ha): no recent records.&#160;[3] El Cocuy National Natural Park (306,000 ha) and Parque Nacional Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (383,000 ha): only small areas of these two parks may still harbor populations of brown spider monkeys, however this needs to be confirmed.&#160;[4] Selva de Florencia: there are some recent records of browns spider monkeys (Roncancio et al. 2012), but population densities seem to be extremely low.In summary, there is a complete lack of information on the current status and potential viability of wild brown spider monkeys that live within the National Parks of Colombia.&#160;In Venezuela, the species occurs in the Guatopo National Park (92,640 ha), which is of particular importance because it is one of the major water reservoirs for the capital city, Caracas. The Sierra de Perijá National Park (295,288 ha) is the other major protected area with brown spider monkeys in Venezuela. In these national parks, enforcing hunting law and regulations for wood extraction are needed. There are no NGOs working actively with <em>Ateles hybridus hybridus </em>as target species, and governmental agencies should improve their conservation efforts. However, there is interest to continue surveys of these primates, especially in central Venezuela, and to implement an awareness programme at a local level. It is also fundamental to increase the number of park rangers and to improve their economic livelihood. Brown spider monkeys also occur in Caparo Forest Reserve (Venezuela) (Duque unpubl. data). <br/><br/>Bernstein <em>et al.</em> (1976a) showed the effect of forest disturbance, especially on <em>A. h. brunneus </em>(and <em>Lagothrix lagothricha lugens</em>), and (1976b) made a plea for the establishment of reserves for this and other threatened primate taxa. Fortunately, the Serranía de San Lucas in southern Bolívar still contains extensive forest which has been identified as a possible national park site. The establishment of a San Lucas National Park ought to have high priority in Colombia, since it would preserve many elements of the Nechí refuge, including <em>Saguinus leucopus</em>, <em>Cebus versicolor </em>and <em>L. l. lugens</em>. However, the presence of political insurgents, the military and some mine fields make the region very difficult to work in and inaccessible for government officials.&#160;<br/><br/>This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
17929907,2282,Ateles marginatus,Endangered,A4cd,2019,2019-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Ateles marginatus</em> is listed as Endangered based upon an inferred or suspected population reduction upwards of 50% (for the period 2006–2050) due to projected and corresponding habitat declines in both protected and unprotected areas, as well as associated declines and population extirpations due to continued high levels of hunting. This combination of factors has impacted one previous generation (15 years; 2006-2020) and will likely impact two succeeding generations (30 years; 2021-2050) in the tropical forests of Brazilian Amazonia.","This species occurs in primary lowland rain forest. Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understorey. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), and besides such as young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars. They play a significant role as seed dispersers. Van Roosmalen (1985; Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that <em>A. paniscus </em>was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory). In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 20-30 individuals (for review see Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groups of varying size and composition (most usually 2-4), the only persistent association being that of a mother and her offspring (McFarland Symington 1990). Group members will also travel on their own. Each female in the group has a “core area” of the group’s home range which she uses most. <em>Ateles</em> are rarely seen in association with other primates and mostly they are occasional and ephemeral, resulting from the simultaneous occupation of fruiting trees.   <br/><br/>Spider monkeys apparently reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1971; Eisenberg 1973, 1976). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with a minimum theoretical interbirth interval in captivity of 17.5 months, but in the wild probably as long as 28-30 months (Eisenberg 1973, 1976). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.","The range of the Brazilian endemic <em>Ateles marginatus </em>is limited to the states of Para and Mato Grosso, cut by major highways such as the Transamazon and the Cuiabá-Santarém, and subject to widespread deforestation due to expanding soy bean farming, cattle ranching and urbanization in what’s referred to as the ‘arc of deforestation’, a region that currently accounts for approximately half of Brazil’s annual forest loss (Nepstad <em>et al</em>. 2014, Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservacao da Biodiversidade 2018).<br/><br/>Highway construction also facilitates hunting, which appears to have resulted in the extirpation of this species in parts of its range (Ravetta and Ferrari 2009). Based on surveys (1987-2005) of more than 100 sites, in areas where Amazonian spider monkeys are heavily hunted, population densities are reported to have declined by as much as 50% (Peres and Palacios 2007).<br/><br/>Construction plans for the Tapajós Hydroelectric Complex (Ravetta 2008, Buss <em>et al</em>. 2017) include a number of dams within the range <em>Ateles marginatus</em>, including two along the Jamanxin River that are projected to flood an estimated 65,000 hectares of tropical forest habitat within four protected areas in which this species presently occurs: Jamanxin National Park, Itaituba I National Forest, Itaituba II National Forest, and the Tapajos Environmental Protection Area (Fearnside 2015).<br/><br/>Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. (2006) project that close to 100 mammal species in Brazilian Amazonia will lose more than 40% of their tropical forest habitat within protected areas and as much as 80% outside of those areas by the year 2050 due to the expansion of cattle and soy industries, and the construction of all-weather highways into the region’s core. This projection is based upon assumptions that the current rates of deforestation and highway construction will continue, compliance with legislation requiring forest reserves on private land will remain low, and new protected areas will not be created. According to Azevedo-Ramos <em>et al</em>. (2006), approximately 60% of Amazonian primate ranges fall outside of protected areas; only one new protected area harbouring this species has been created since it was last assessed.","<p>The size of the remaining population is not known, and it is not possible to indicate that the number of mature individuals is greater than 10,000.

Barbosa <em>et al</em>. (1988, in Mast et al. 1993) also recorded the species at Quibdo, a town just east of the upper Río Atrato. In discussing habitat preference in Panama, Moynihan (1970) stated that rufous-napped tamarins are abundant in some parts of the Pacific coastal region, and also occur in some central areas approximately equidistant from both coasts. However, they are completely absent from the whole of the Atlantic coast of the isthmus, except for one small, highly modified or “unnatural” area. The exception he mentioned is around the Canal Zone, the city of Colón, and Lake Gatún where the original forest has been almost entirely destroyed, and Moynihan (1970, 1976) argued that their occurrence there is the result of a recent range extension. The map of localities provided by Hershkovitz (1977, p.915) confirms Moynihan’s observation, with only two records on the Atlantic side of the isthmus except in the vicinity of the Canal Zone. The two outlying Atlantic coast records listed in the gazetteer (p.925) are: Locality 6c, San Blas, Mandinga, 9º27'N, 79º04'W, C. O.

They can persist in disturbed forests close to human settlements. They range over all layers of the forest, but travelling and foraging is mainly in the middle layers (Castro Coronado 1991, Heymann &amp; Buchanan-Smith 2000, Norconk 1990, Peres 1991). Home-range size varies between 25 and &gt;50 ha in <em>S. m. mystax</em> groups (Castro Coronado 1991, Heymann 2000), and between 85 and 141 ha in <em>S. m. pileatus </em>(Peres 1992a). The diet is composed of fruit pulp, exudates, nectar, invertebrates and small vertebrates (Castro Coronado 1991, Garber 1988a,b, Heymann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Knogge &amp; Heymann 2003, Nickle &amp; Heymann 1996, Peres 1993a, 1996, Smith 2000). Group size ranges from 3-12 and averages 5-6 individuals in<em> S. m. mystax</em>, (Löttker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Moya <em>et al.</em>&#160;1990, Soini &amp; Coppula 1981) and from 8-11 individuals (mean 8.6) in <em>S. m. pileatus</em> (Peres 1991). Moustached tamarins routinely form interspecific associations with smaller tamarins like <em>Leontocebus nigrifrons</em>, and <em>Leontocebus fuscicollis avilapiresi </em>and <em>Leontocebus fuscicollis fuscicollis </em>(Garber 1988a, Heymann and Buchanan-Smith 2000, Peres 1991, 1992a,b, 1993b, 1996). Benefits of these associations include shared vigilance, eavesdropping on alarm calls and access to food resources (Kirchhof &amp; Hammerschmidt 2006, Peres 1993b, Stojan-Dolar &amp; Heymann 2010). The mating system includes polyandry and monogamy, vary rarely polygyny or polygynandry (Garber 1997, Huck <em>et al.</em> 2005, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2003).Adult females are larger and heavier than adult males.

The same is undoubtedly true for the Brazilian populations. Johns (1985, 1986) found it to be the most abundant of the primates at his study site on the west margin of the Rio Tefé, and likewise it was found to be common in three sites surveyed by Peres (1990).<br/>Nothing is known of the conservation status of <em>Saguinus</em> <em>mystax pileatus </em>and <em>Saguinus mystax pluto</em>, but there is no reason to believe either form is currently threatened.","Population densities between 8 and 87.8&#160; individuals/km² have been reported for <em>S. m. mystax</em> (Moya <em>et al.</em>&#160;1990, Peres 1997, Puertas &amp; Bodmer 1993, Soini &amp; Soini 1982), and 71.5 individuals/km² for <em>S. m. pileatus</em> (Peres 1997).",Decreasing,"There are three recognized subspecies:<br/><em>Saguinus mystax mystax</em>Spix’s Moustached Tamarin occurs in Peru, south of the Río Amazonas, west to the Ríos Ucayali and Tapiche, south to the junction of the Ríos Urubamba and Ucayali (Hershkovitz 1977, Soini and Soini 1990). Soini and Soini (1990) reported that its Peruvian distribution is more restricted than was indicated by Hershkovitz (1977), occurring only as far west as the east banks of the middle and lower Río Tapiche and lower Río Ucayali. Further south, it extends west again as far as the Río Ucayali, crossing the Río Tapiche at about 6º 40'S. This is based on a specimen from Cerro Azul, Contamana, collected by R. W. Hendee in 1927. Pekka Soini never recorded a moustached tamarin in the basins of the Ríos Pacaya and Samiria despite many years of research there (since 1979), and a specimen from the mouth of the Samiria west of the Río Ucayali (locality 96, Hershkovitz 1977, p.684) collected by H. Bluntschli in 1927 is as such enigmatic. According to Hershkovitz (1979) and the distribution map provided by Aquino and Encarnación (1994), the southernmost limit in Peru is marked by the Ríos Urubamba and Inuya. This is based on the southernmost specimen known for this subspecies from Lagarto on the right bank of the Río Ucayali (Hershkovitz 1977, locality 110, 10º41'S, 73º48'W), collected by the Olalla Brothers in 1928. <em>S. imperator subgrisescens</em> replaces <em>S. m. mystax</em> south of the Ríos Urubamba and Inuya (Hershkovitz 1979). In their text (as opposed to their distribution map), Aquino and Encarnación (1994) give the Río Sheshea, an eastern tributary of the Río Ucayali to the north of the Río Urubamba, as the southern limit, although there is no evidence given for this.<br/>In Brazil, <em>S. m. mystax</em> occurs south of the Rio Solimões, and is largely restricted to the west of the Rio Juruá (Hershkovitz 1977). However, Peres (1990, 1991) recorded <em>S. m. mystax</em> from Jaraqui on the right (east) bank of the lower Rio Juruá. Likewise, Johns (1985, 1986) found that <em>S. m. mystax</em> the Moustached Tamarin occurring on the west bank of the Rio Tefé (east of the lower Río Juruá), with <em>S. m. pileatus</em> replacing it on the east bank. Above the headwaters of the Rio Tefé, the Moustached Tamarin occurring on the right (east) bank of the Rio Juruá is <em>S. m. pileatus</em>, this based on a specimen collected by E. Garbe in 1902, at approximately 7ºS (Hershkovitz 1977).<br/><em>Saguinus mystax pileatus</em>According to Hershkovitz (1977), <em>S. m. pileatus</em> occurs south of the Rio Solimões, west of the Rio Purus, south at least as far as the Rio Pauiní or Rio Mamoria. Although Hershkovitz (1977) indicated that it occurs west to the lower Rio Juruá, Johns (1985, 1986) found that the Rio Tefé, its type locality, was its western limit. Judging from a specimen from ‘Juruá (Rio), Amazonas’ (locality 174b, Hershkovitz 1977, p.684), <em>S. m. pileatus</em> extends west to the Rio Juruá above the headwaters of the Rio Tefé. Despite Hershkovitz’s (1977) conviction that <em>S. m. pileatus</em> occurs east as far the Rio Purus on its lower reaches (that is east of the Rio Coarí), we argue that the limited evidence for the distributions of these tamarins suggests that it only reaches the Rio Purus above the Rio Tapauá, with <em>S. m. pluto</em> occurring from the Rio Tapauá, along the left bank of the Rio Purus downriver, and as far west as the Rio Coarí (see the description of the geographic range of <em>S. m. pluto</em>). <em>S. m. pileatus</em> is sympatric with<em> S. fuscicollis avilapiresi</em> throughout its known range.<br/><em>Saguinus mystax pluto</em>The distribution of <em>S. m. pluto</em> is rather problematic. Hershkovitz (1968, 1977) argued that it occurs south of the Rio Solimões, between the Rios Purus and Madeira, south to at least 7° or 8° latitude, but the southern limits are not known. The distribution as described by Hershkovitz is based on three localities: 1) The type locality, Lago Ayapuá is on the left (west) bank of the Rio Purus, but Hershkovitz (1977) argued that it must have come from the right bank. 2) Lago do Mapixí, a lake on the right bank of the Rio Purus. Although Hershkovitz states that specimens from Lago do Mapixí are labelled ‘eastern of Rio Purus’ (1977, p.700), this is contradicted in Hershkovitz’s gazeteer (p.933, locality 185, Lago do Mapixí), which states under <em>S. m. pluto</em> ‘C. Lako, June 1931 (left bank of Purus)’. A specimen of <em>S. labiatus</em>, of the same collector with the same date and locality, is ascribed to the right bank of the Purus. (3) Jaburú, on the left bank of the Rio Purus (locality 186, p.933). As in the Ayapuá locality, Hershkovitz (1977) insists that the specimens were in fact taken from the right bank of the Rio Purus and even places the locality on the right bank in the distribution map for <em>S. mystax</em> (p.684, 1977). The problem with accepting that <em>S. m. pluto</em> is known only from the left bank of the Rio Purus is that it would have to be sympatric with <em>S. m. pileatus</em>. Ávila-Pires (1974) placed <em>S. m. pluto</em> to the west of the Rio Purus, and regarded it as a different species for this reason. However, the only specimen of <em>S. m. pileatus</em> recorded for the Rio Purus is São Luis da Mamoria, Rio Purus (locality 188,p.933, Hershkovitz 1977), which is far to the south, near the Rio Pauiní. Although different species, it would be very difficult to accept that <em>S. mystax</em> is sympatric with <em>S. labiatus</em>, because, along with<em> S. imperator</em>, they are evidently ecologically very similar. We suggest that<em> S. m. pluto</em> is in fact restricted to the left bank of the Rio Purus, but is not sympatric with <em>S. m. pileatus</em>, and probably extends east as far as the Rio Coarí and south only to the rio Tapauá. The Mamoria locality for <em>S. m. pileatus</em> is downstream of the mouth of the Rio Pauini and upstream of the mouth of the Rio Tapauá. The Lago do Ipixuna, another locality (183, p.933, Hershkovitz 1977) for <em>S. m. pileatus</em>, is west of the Rio Coarí. There is no evidence of<em> S. m. pileatus</em> occurring east of the Rio Coarí, nor north of the Rio Tapauá.<br/>Izawa and Bejarano (1981) reported two isolated populations of <em>S. mystax</em> from the south of the Rio Acre, north of the Río Tahuamanú, in Bolivia: one between Cobija and Buenos Aires, right bank of the Rio Acre, and another from 10 km north-east of Porvenir, 11°12'S, on the Brazil/Bolivia frontier beyond the headwaters of the Rio Abunã. Izawa and Bejarano (1981) presumed them to be <em>S. m. pluto</em> because Hershkovitz (1977) extended its range south as far as the Abunã headwaters. According to Izawa and Bejarano (1981), these two populations of<em> S. mystax</em> are sympatric with <em>S. labiatus</em>, but do not form mixed species groups as they do independently with <em>S. fuscicollis</em>. There is no ready explanation for these Bolivian populations, more than 3 degrees to the south of the southernmost locality for <em>S. m. pileatus</em>. We consider that they are unlikely to be <em>S. m. pluto</em>, but may be <em>S. m. pileatus</em> (if they cross the upper Rio Purus) or, more likely, a different undescribed subspecies. Izawa and Bejarano (1981) also report a population of <em>S. imperator</em> within the distribution of <em>S. labiatus</em>, along with a new form of <em>S. labiatus</em> (undescribed). It would appear that the distributions of these species are mixed, forming fine-grained mosaics, in the southernmost parts of their ranges, traversing headwaters in a region lacking large rivers as barriers. <em>S. mystax</em> distributions are evidently more complex than portrayed by Hershkovitz (1977) and require further study.

It does not occur around the city of Manaus, the domain of <em>Saguinus bicolor</em>, and shows only a narrow zone where it mixes with this species on the periphery of <em>S. bicolor</em>'s range (Ayres <em>et al.</em> 1980). The situation is probably the same with the two <em>Saguinus martinsi</em> subspecies. In the north of its range,<em> Saguinus midas</em> occurs in French Guiana, Suriname and Guyana (Husson 1957), but is largely restricted to the east of the Essequibo River (Norconk <em>et al</em>. 1996). It would seem that it has crossed the Essequibo along the lower reaches of the river, judging by sightings at Hosororo Hill on the Venezuelan border and from Waraputa on the west bank of the Essequibo just south of Mabura Hill (Sussman and Phillips-Conroy 1995, Norconk <em>et al.</em> 1996). There had been no reports of callitrichids occurring in Venezuela (Handley 1976, Bodini and Pérez-Hernández 1987), until Linares (1998) indicated its occurrence in eastern Bolívar.

Between the rios Xingu and Tocantins, it is largely restricted to the dense lowland forests of the flat Tertiary/Quaternary floodplain of the Amazon, and is limited in the south by the montane and submontane forests of the Brazilian Shield (Ferrari and Lopes Ferrari 1990). Between the rios Xingu and Tapajós it ranges further south, entering mixed open forest. It has been observed in forest patches in Amazonian white-sand savanna at Alter do Chão, south of Santarém, Rio Tapajós (Albernaz and Magnusson 1999). <br/><br/>Sympatric in part of their range with <em>Saguinus niger</em> (see Veracini 1997).

They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species forms a notable component of the diet (Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1976; Rylands 1984). They live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals. Mean group sizes recored by Gonçalves <em>et al.</em> (2003) in four localities in the west of its tnage were as follows: 1) 5.3 ±1.3; 2) 5.0 ± 0.9; 3) 5.6 ±2.1; and 3) 7.6 ±1.2. The group studied by Veracini (1997) and Tavares (Tavares and Ferrari 2002) on the Rio Curuá ranged from eight to 10 individuals. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season.

The Black-faced Lion Tamarin is a frugivorous-faunivorous species. Although animals feed mainly on plant (fruits, exudates, flowers and nectar), and animal food items (frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects), they also eat fungi (Prado 1999, Kierulff <em>et al.</em> 2002, Prado and Valladares-Padua 2004, Ludwig 2011, Oliveira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).","This species is threatened mainly by disconnection of its habitat, habitat reduction, loss and degradation of the habitat, urban expansion, reduced protection in its distributional area, disarticulation between environmental agencies and unplanned ecotourism (Moro-Rios <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite the fact that most of the known distribution is protected in Integral Protection Conservation Units, the species have a restricted distribution and low population density. Therefore, effective conservation programs are essential to protect the species.","Methodological differences certainly account for the inconsistencies in population estimates. While Lorini and Persson (1994) estimated a total population not exceeding 260 animals, Nascimento<em> et al. </em>(2011a) reported 392 individuals. If one considers 400 as the total population, there would be about 160 mature individuals, with groups encompassing one or two adult males (A.T.A. Nascimento, personal communication). Group size averages 4.85 (n = 7 and ranges from two to nine individuals (Martins<em> et al.</em> 2015). Even considering the highest population estimates, it is suspected that there are no more than 250 mature individuals. Population densities are in the order of 8 individuals/km² and 7 individuals/km² in Superagui Island (by different methods) (Ludwig 2011) and 1.79 individuals/km² (95% CI 0.69–4.69) (Nascimento <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Population trend: In decline. Studies carried out by Lorini and Persson (1994) and Nascimento <em>et al.</em> (2011a) have similar estimates, with estimated values ​​in 1994 within the confidence interval presented in 2011. Signals of population loss as well as a decrease in genetic diversity on the island and mainland were recorded by using microsatellite genotyping (Martins <em>et al</em>. 2011). An update of population estimates is needed, because data presented by Nascimento <em>et al</em>. (2011a) were collected between 2000 and 2001. Further studies of population density should focus on the mainland and regard the habitat heterogeneity between the island and continent (A.T.A. Nascimento, personal communication; Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011).",Decreasing,"The Black-faced Lion Tamarin is endemic to Brazil, occurring in the states of Paraná and São Paulo, where it is resident and native (Lorini and Persson 1994, Kierulff <em>et al. </em>2008). The species occupies the southernmost limits of the distribution of the callitrichids in the Atlantic Forest (Rylands <em>et al</em>. 2002). There are at least two main populations: insular (Superagui Island, Guaraqueçaba/PR) and continental (Ariri in Cananeia/SP; Rio Sebuí Valley and Sebuí region, in Guaraqueçaba/PR). The distribution is limited in the north by the Rio Varadorzinho, and in the west by the Serra da Utinga, Morro do Bico Torto, Morro do Poruquara and Serra do Gigante (Persson and Lorini 1991, 1993). Martuscelli and Rodrigues (1992) reported four localities in the extreme south-east of São Paulo, two in the basin of the Rio do Turvo (Rio do Turvo and Morro do Teixeira) and two further north in the region of Itapitangui. Valladares-Padua <em>et al.</em> (2000) reported the species between the villages of Ariri and Taquari, in the municipality of Cananeia, and suggested that its range may extend only a short distance to the north. The species is restricted to lower altitudinal areas in coastal regions (Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011). Despite efforts in surveys by IPÊ Institution in studying the distribution across the continental region in 2000 (Valladares-Padua<em> et al.</em> 2000; Prado <em>et al.</em> 2003), the low density registered (1.79 individuals/km²) (Nascimento <em>et al.</em> 2011a) and the small size of the species makes it cryptic and difficult to record. Therefore, it is necessary for more surveys to be carried out on the distribution in the continental region, like Serra do Mar in Ribeira Valley. <br/><br/>There is no indication that the current distribution is reduced compared to that in the past.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence is 359 km² (area within a minimum convex polygon around the mapped occurrence); the known area of occupancy (AOO) is 244 km² (Schmidlin 2004).",,Terrestrial,"National Red List Category from the Previous Assessment: CR - C2a(i); E.

There is no captive breeding program for the species (Ballou <em>et al</em>. 2002). There are no individuals in captivity.&#160;This species occurs in the following protected areas:Lagamar Mosaic, that includes 43 conservation units (UCs) in the states of São Paulo and Paraná (MMA, 2006 - Portaria Federal n° 150, May 8, 2006). <br/><br/>Paraná: Guaraqueçaba Environmental Protection Area (282,444.0200 ha) and Superagui National Park (33,860.3600 ha) (Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1993, Lorini and Persson 1994, Vivekananda 1994).<br/><br/>São Paulo: Cananeia-Iguape-Peruíbe Environmental Protection Area (160,000 ha) (Lorini and Persson 1994), Lagamar de Cananeia State Park (PELC) (40,758 ha), Tumba Island Extractive Reserve (1,595 ha), Itapanhapima Sustainable Development Reserve (1,242 ha) and Taquari Extractive Reserve (1,622 ha).&#160;Considerable efforts are being devoted to research on the species and implement environmental education programs. In the last 10 years, the endeavours of IPÊ in Ariri region, Cananeia, SP (2005-2014) contributed, to the decrease of 20-30% of direct threats identified in 2005 (Nascimento 2014, Nascimento <em>et al</em>., in prep.).&#160;The main recommendations to conservation programs of the species were first presented in PHVA 2005 (Holst <em>et al</em>. 2006), which resulted in the creation of the state conservation plan from São Paulo and Paraná.

If subpopulations decline linearly, in 21 years, an overall reduction of more than 30% could be anticipated. If subpopulations decline more abruptly, if forest cover loss accelerates and/or if this species is impacted by yellow fever as significantly as the closely-related <em>L. rosalia</em> recently has been, a population reduction of 50% or more in three generations could be predicted.   </p>","Lowland seasonal rain forest along the Atlantic coast of Brazil, white sand piaçava forest and secondary forest. Also known to use cabruca - cacao plantations that are shaded with some few native trees remaining from the original forest. They have been observed in secondary growth forest, in abandoned rubber plantations, but evidently always require old-growth forest providing abundant tree holes, which are used as sleeping sites, and epiphytic bromeliads, which are key foraging sites. Lion tamarins are an adaptable species well able to live in degraded and secondary forests, depending on sufficient year round food resources and foraging sites (see Coimbra-Filho 1969, 1976; Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1973). Near the coast, in the cocoa growing region, there is no distinct dry season with rainfall exceeding 2,000 mm a year (the heaviest rains are from March to June). In the west of their range the forests are mesophytic with a distinct dry season, and in some areas the forests are semi-deciduous, with rainfall as low as 1,000 mm a year (Rylands 1989; Pinto and Rylands 1997). <br/><br/>Golden Headed Lion Tamarins eat mostly ripe fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums) and animal prey, including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects, mostly found in epiphytic tank bromeliads (Raboy and Dietz 2004, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2010, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;Golden-headed Lion Tamarins live in extended family groups of usually 4–8 individuals (maximum of 15 individuals) depending on forest type (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. Reproductive female lion tamarins may produce 1–2 offspring per litter, and up to two litters per year (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994; Holst <em>et al.</em> 2006), with peaks from October to December and February to May. In cabruca agroforests all litters consisted of twins in every reproductive season (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2011), while Holst <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported females having four offspring a year (two litters of twins). Dietz <em>et al.</em> (1996) observed 13 litters (20 infants) from seven reproductive females in which 54% were twins and 46% singletons. Similarly, Bach <em>et al</em>. (2001) reported two litters per year for only 27% of reproductive females. Groups defend home ranges of 40 to more than 100 ha (the size depending on availability and distribution of foods and second-growth patches). A group studied by Rylands (1982, 1989) in the Lemos Maia Experimental Station, Una, used a home range of about 40 ha. Home ranges in the Una Biological Reserve were found to be larger, reaching from 65 up to 200 ha (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1996). Raboy &amp; Dietz (2004) reported an average home range size of 123 ha based on three groups (ranging from 119 to 130 ha) while Oliveira <em>et al.</em> (2011) reported home range size to vary within different habitat types. The average home range size in cabruca was 45 ha (ranging from 22-84 ha), while groups from primary forests had average home ranges of 140 ha (ranging from 93-197 ha) and in mosaic forest (primary and secondary forests and cabrucas within the species home range) averaging 65 ha (ranging from 64-66 ha) (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2011). <br/><br/>French<em> et al.</em> (2002) reviewed the reproductive biology of lion tamarins, Baker <em>et al.</em> (2002) review their mating system and group dynamics (focusing particularly on<em> L. rosalia</em>) and Tardif <em>et al</em>. (2002) investigated aspects of infant care and development.<br/><br/>The size (weight) of Golden-headed Lion Tamarins also varied based on habitat type.&#160; Adult male: 584.6 g (n=9) in primary forest; 604 g (n=9) in mosaic (primary and secondary forests and cabrucas); and 668 g (n=12) in cabruca agroforest (Oliveira et al. 2011).&#160;Adult female: 586.7 g (n=8) in primary forest; 624 g (n=4) in mosaic forest (primary and secondary forests and cabrucas); 638 g (n=4) in cabruca agroforest (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, non-pregnant adult female may reach up to 800g in cabruca agroforest (Oliveira L.C. unpublished data).","With more than 100 localities where <em>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</em> still occurs, more populations remain than for the other three lion tamarin species combined. However, the remaining forests are destroyed at an unprecedented rate and those populations surviving are seriously depleted and fragmented. An important aspect, which has contributed to the more favourable situation of the Golden-headed Lion Tamarins, is the traditional and widespread use of the cabruca system for shading cacao trees. Some original canopy trees are left, allowing connectivity between forest patches. If well managed, this could be an important management tool for future conservation efforts. <br/><br/>Threats to Golden-headed Lion Tamarins come from socio-economic transformations resulting from increasing labour costs, low cacao prices and decreasing cacao yields after the appearance of the Witches' Broom Fungus (<em>Moniliophthora perniciosa</em>) in Bahia. Such situation led to logging and sometimes to conversion of cabrucas to alternative crops, notably African palm oil and coconuts (Alger and Caldas 1994, 1996; Araujo <em>et al.</em> 1998), followed by rehabilitation measures that often go along with thinning of the shade canopies (Schroth <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In the west of its range, forests are increasingly destroyed and fragmented because of cattle ranching (Pinto 1994, Pinto and Rylands 1997, Raboy <em>et al. </em>2010). Coffee plantation especially in the municipalities of Santa Luzia, Camacan and Juçari increasingly substitute shaded cacao plantation posing another threat for the tamarins. &#160;<br/><br/>It is believed that inbreeding depression occurs within the isolated populations of <em>L. chrysomelas</em>, especially in the western half of its range where forest fragmentation is extreme (Pinto and Rylands 1997). Recently, Moraes (2011) observed loss of genetic diversity among wild populations of Golden-headed Lion Tamarins.<br/><br/>Zeigler <em>et al.</em> (2010) estimated a 13% loss within the suitable forest habitat for <em>L. chrysomelas</em> between 1987 and 2007.&#160; The majority of the remaining patches were too small to support tamarin groups over the long-term, with only 5% being large enough to support genetically viable populations.&#160; According to Zeigler <em>et al.</em> (2013), all 10 <em>L. chrysomelas</em> sub-populations that were the subjects of population viability analyses were predicted to be extirpated within an average of 65 years if the annual rate of forest loss in Bahia at the time of the study was to double.&#160; According to Global Forest Watch data, it has done so, declining at a rate of between 1% and 2% annually.&#160; If sub-populations decline in number linearly in response to habitat loss, in 21 years (three generations time) an overall population reduction of more than 30% could be anticipated. If subpopulations decline more abruptly and/or if forest cover loss accelerates, a population reduction of 50% or more in three generations could be predicted within that time period.","The total wild population in the mid-1990s was estimated to be 6,000-15,000 animals (Pinto 1994, Pinto and Rylands 1997), which would have translated to a maximum of 6,000 mature individuals based on an average group size of five animals. The most recent population estimates put the total number of mature individuals at less than 2,500 (Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservacao da Biodiversidade 2018). The estimated population in the Una Biological Reserve in the mid-1990s (at that time measuring 7,059 ha) was 400-450 individuals. However, the reserve has since expanded to a size of 18,500 ha, and holds an estimated population of about 1,100 <em>L. chrysomelas</em> (based on the PHVA 2005, Holst <em>et al.</em> 2006). This likely represents 250 or more mature individuals.<br/><p> Densities vary according to habitat type and time. First reports on population density were provided by Rylands (1982, 1989), reporting 5.0-17.0 individuals/km² in a forest fragment at municipality of Una, in Lemos Maia Experimental Station. In Una Biological Reserve, different estimations were made over time. Dietz <em>et al. </em>(1994) reported densities of around 8.0 individuals/km² and two years later, they estimated a density of 5.0 individuals/km² (Dietz <em>et al.</em> 1996). In a compilation of unpublished data from Una Biological Reserve, Holst <em>et al. </em>(2006) reported densities of 10 individuals/km² and 11 individuals/km² in a more preserved and in a degraded part of the reserve, respectively. In a semi-deciduous forest, Guidorizzi (2008) reported a density of seven individuals/km². Recently, a population density estimation within the species’ ranges was conducted in three different habitat types, being primary forest, a mosaic of primary and secondary forest and cacao agroforest or cabruca. The average density of tamarins in cabruca areas was 17 individuals/km² (range: 10–21 individuals/km²), the highest density ever recorded for the species. The average density in mosaic forest was 13 individuals/km² (range: 8–18 individuals/km²), and six individuals/km² in primary forest (range: 4–11 individuals/km²) (Oliveita<em> et al.</em> 2011).<br/></p><p>  </p><p><br/>&#160;&#160;</p>  <p></p>",Decreasing,"Golden-headed Lion Tamarin is a species of the Atlantic forest in Brazil, found in forest fragments in the state of Bahia and formerly in the extreme Northeast of Minas Gerais. The distribution of <em>L. chrysomelas </em>originally extended between the Rio de Contas (northern limit) and the Rio Pardo (southern limit) in southern Bahia (Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1977). However, it was also found south of the Rio Pardo along its middle reaches to the Rio Jequitinhonha on the border between the states of Bahia and Minas Gerais (probably a recent range extension due to forest destruction and the silting of the Rio Pardo; Rylands <em>et al.</em> 1988, 1991/1992). In the Northwest, it occurs on both banks of the lower Rio Gongoji, a southern tributary of the Rio de Contas, but along its middle reaches, it is limited to the West of the river, and to the West of the Rio Novo. It crosses the Rio Gongoji, westward, again at its headwaters, occurring in the basin of the Rio Catolé Grande, a northern tributary of the Rio Pardo, which forms the westernmost extent of its range (Pinto and Rylands 1997). The western limits are defined by vegetational changes (mesophytic forest changing to liana forest in the west of its range) associated with an increase in altitude approaching the plateau of Vitoria da Conquista. The westernmost point is about 150 km from the coast. To the south, <em>L. chrysomelas</em> crosses the Rio Pardo, occurring in the lower basin of the Rio Maiquinique and east of the Córrego Pau Grande, south to the Rio Jequitinhonha in the extreme Northeast of Minas Gerais (Pinto and Rylands 1997). Although a decrease in range size was observed (mainly on the west of the species’ geographical distribution; Raboy <em>et al.</em> 2010), the range of the golden-headed lion tamarin still extends over an area of approximately 19,000 km² (Pinto and Rylands 1997).<br/><br/>There are two gaps in the range, one in the north near the coast, south of the lower Rio de Contas to the mouth of the Rio Ilhéus, and the other between the lower reaches of the Rio Pardo and the Rio Jequitinhonha (Pinto and Tavares 1994; Pinto and Rylands 1997). Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier (1973, 1977) argued that the original range of <em>L. chrysomelas </em>extended only to the Rio Pardo in the South, and that deforestation and the silting of the river (see Coimbra-Filho and Câmara 1996) has resulted in lion tamarins crossing the river in recent times (i.e., during the last century) and thus explaining today's presence in those areas and the absence between the Jequitinhonha and Pardo Rivers further east. There is no obvious explanation for the absence of <em>L. chrysomelas</em> between the Rio de Contas and the Rio Ilhéus in the Northeast of its range.<br/><br/>There is an introduced population in the State of Rio de Janeiro (Kierulff 2010), which has been translocated to the state of Bahia.","In the past, this species suffered the impacts of illegal trade, for commercial collections or as pets. Precise numbers are not available, but it was common to find this species sold along the main roads in southern Bahia. In addition, some parts of the current captive population, in Brazil and other countries, may probably originate from this illegal trade. To date, the illegal off-take is much reduced, due to national and international regulations and to improved law enforcement. However, it is still common to find tamarins as pets in the private households within the species' range.&#160;Additionally, the magnitude of the past trade still needs to be revealed, but can bring unpredictable impacts. This is the case if non-indigenous individuals escape from captivity or are deliberately released into the wild. For example, the<em> L. chrysomelas</em> invasive population living at Niterói, in Rio de Janeiro State, formed from released pets, represents a severe threat to the closest populations of the native <em>Leontopithecus rosalia</em> (almost 40 km).",Terrestrial,"Included on the Brazilian Official List of Species Threatened with Extinction (Lista Oficial de Espécies Brasileiras Ameaçadas de Extinção, Edict No. 1.522/19th December 1989, see Bernardes <em>et al.</em> 1990; Fonseca <em>et al. </em>1994), and likewise on the regional list of threatened species in the state of Minas Gerais (Machado <em>et al.</em> 1998). It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.<br/><br/>The Una Biological Reserve (18,500 ha), created to protect <em>L. chrysomelas</em>, has an estimated population of about 1,000 animals (Holst <em>et al.</em> 2006). A key strategy, which has guided conservation efforts over the last decade, is to promote the preservation of the forests adjacent to the Reserve (Alger and Araújo 1996, Alger <em>et al.</em> 1996, Blanes and Mallinson 1997, Santos and Blanes 1997, 1999). Besides the Una Biological Reserve, this species also occurs in: Serra das Lontras National Park (16,800 ha), Una Wildlife Refuge (23,000 ha), Lemos Maia Experimental Station (CEPLAC/CEPEC) (495 ha), and Canavieiras Experimental Station (CEPLAC/CEPEC) (500 ha), Djalma Bahia Experimental Station (145 ha) and in many private reserves (RPPN) such as Serra do Teimoso, Ararauna, Serra Bonita.

Golden lion tamarins are an adaptable species well able to live in degraded and secondary forests, depending only on sufficient year round food sources and foraging sites, along with the tree holes they use as sleeping sites (see Coimbra-Filho 1969, 1976; Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1973).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size; modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe; the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects).<br/><br/>A book edited by Kleiman and Rylands (2002) contains chapters that extensively review behavioural ecology, reproductive biology, mating systems, infant care, vocal communication, conservation status and reintroduction biology. A more recent book edited by Oliveria <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2008) reviews information on habitat fragmentation, invasive species and conservation strategies for golden lion tamarins.&#160; Lion tamarins are an insectivore-frugivore species, with opportunistic consumption of tree exudates. They differ from other callitrichids in having long fingers and hands, which allow them to forage for prey efficiently in nooks and crannies and in epiphytic tank bromeliads. Lion tamarins live in extended family groups of usually 4 to 8 individuals. For <em>L. rosalia</em>, Dietz and Kleiman (1986) recorded a mean group size of 5.8 (range 3-11, n=21) at the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve. Recently, Hankerson and Dietz (2014) compared group sizes in two different predation periods. Average group size (excluding infants) was 4.4 individuals during high predation periods and 6.0 individuals during low predation periods (Hankerson and Dietz 2014). Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. They breed once or twice a year. There is cooperative care of the young.&#160; Both sexes disperse. Average dispersal distance is 847 meters (Mickleberg, 2011). The groups defend home ranges of 40 to more than 100 ha. Hankerson &amp; Dietz (2014) reported home ranges sizes based on different group sizes (small (&lt;4.5 individuals), medium (4.5 to 7.9 individuals) or large (&gt;8 individuals) in Poço das Antas Biological Reserve. The authors found home ranges varying from (mean ± SE) 66.9 ± 3.71 ha for large groups (N =17), 49.7 ± 1.96 ha for medium-sized groups (N=66) and 46.7 ± 1.99 ha (N=62) for small size groups.&#160; Important determinants of home range size were predation and future reproductive needs. At the União Biological Reserve, home ranges average 150 ±72 ha (range 65-229 ha) (Kierulff 2000).","<p>Historically, <em>Leontopithecus rosalia</em> has been threatened by severe forest loss and fragmentation, as well as live capture for the pet trade.&#160; Today, the most severe threats facing this species are the urbanization of former forests and pastureland, an expanding road network (e.g., BR 101) that further fragments remaining forest blocks and conservation management units, the potential for stochastic events such as a recent yellow fever outbreak, competition with introduced <em>Callithrix jacchus</em>, and hybridization with introduced <em>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</em>  (Bicca-Marques <em>et al.</em> 2017, Ruiz-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2019, J. Dietz unpublished data).&#160; An overall population estimated at 3,700 (1,400 mature individuals) is spread among nearly 20 sub-populations; 60% of these inhabit patches of 1,000 ha or less, 96% of which are less than 100 ha (Kierulff and Procópio de Oliveira 1996).&#160; Many of the sub-populations are believed to have reached carrying capacity and are potentially non-viable in the long-term due to the potential for inbreeding depression <em></em>(Kierulff and Procópio de Oliveira 1996, Dietz <em>et al.</em> 2000). A documented reduction of <em>L. rosalia</em> of greater than 50% in the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve in the 1990s gives cause for concern regarding the potential for significant population fluctuations (Franklin and Dietz 2001), including a decline of more than 30% recently documented due to an outbreak fo yellow fever (J. Dietz unpublished data).<br/></p>","In 2003, the species was downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered, as a result of nearly thirty years of conservation efforts, involving numerous institutions, through the Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Program (GLTCP) of the National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, and the Associação Mico-Leao-Dourado, Rio de Janeiro. Conservation efforts have included the establishment of a new population through translocation of 47 individuals in six groups, each isolated and evidently otherwise doomed in tiny isolated forests elsewhere, to a new protected area, the União Biological Reserve. Currently, about one-third of the wild population are descendants of a reintroduction programme. The reintroduction of captive-born Golden Lion Tamarins has contributed significantly not only to the numbers living in the wild, but also to the protection of 3,100 ha of forests within their range (Beck et al. 1986, 1991, 1994; Stoinski et al. 1997; Beck and Martins 1999, 2001).<br/><br/>Early estimates of population size ranged from 200-600 (Coimbra-Filho 1969; Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1973, 1977), but it was only in 1991-1992 that a full and thorough census was carried out by Kierulff (1993a,b; Kierulff and Procópio de Oliveira 1996). Not including the population in the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, the total number of individuals estimated was 272 in 55 groups. They were divided amongst 14 forests - four main subpopulations with six or more groups each and 12 groups isolated in 10 forest fragments each of 200 ha or less in area. The total area of forest containing Golden Lion Tamarins was 104.5 km². The majority of groups (29) were located in the municipality of Silva Jardim (53%), 24 groups were located in Cabo Frio (43%), and one group each were found in the municipalities of Saquarema and one in Araruama. At the time, the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve was known to harbour about 290 lion tamarins (Kierulff 1993a), giving a total population of 562 (range 470-631), close to the estimate of Coimbra-Filho in 1969.<br/><br/>During Kierulff's (1993) census, the population of reintroduced lion tamarins was 118 individuals, but by December 2000, the number had risen to 359 (Kierulff<em> et al.</em> 2002a, b). A translocation programme, begun in 1994, established a new and thriving population in the União Biological Reserve, with six introduced groups resulting in a population of over 120 lion tamarins in the Reserve by mid-2001 (Kierulff <em>et al</em>. 2002a). The forests targeted for re-introduction are now believed to be at carrying capacity, and Kierulff and Procópio de Oliveira (1996) estimated that the União Biological Reserve (at 2,400 ha the second largest single block of lowland forest in the state, after the marginally larger Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, with 2,760 ha of forest) can hold no more than about 158 lion tamarins (33 groups).<br/><br/>From 1997 to 2000 the numbers in the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve declined due to predation to just 220 animals (see Franklin and Dietz 2001), but since the population has recovered to an estimated 408 animals (AMLD, unpublished data).<br/><br/>Based on Kierulff's 1993 census, the population of reintroduced golden lion tamarins was 118. By December 2000 the number had risen to 359 (Kierulff<em> et al.</em> 2002a,b). A translocation programme, begun in 1994, established a new and thriving population in the União Biological Reserve; six introduced groups yielded a population of &gt;120 lion tamarins by mid-2001 (Kierulff <em>et al</em>. 2002a). The forests targeted for re-introduction are now believed to be at carrying capacity.&#160; Kierulff and Procópio de Oliveira (1996) estimated that the 2,400-ha União Biological Reserve (the second largest single block of lowland forest in the state) can hold no more than about 158 lion tamarins (33 groups).  <p>The most recent population estimate for <em>Leontopithecus rosalia</em>, based on 3,200 individuals in the Sao Joao and Macae River Basins (AMLD 2018), would be just above 3,700 (Ruiz-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2019). Based upon an average group size of five for the genus <em>Leontopithecus</em>, with two mature individuals per group, the total number of mature individuals would be approximately 1,400. However, subsequent to data collection for the most recent population estimate, GLT populations were hit by yellow fever. Replicated surveys in each of 13 forest fragments holding <em>L. rosalia</em> yield an overall population loss of 32% (J. Dietz unpublished data).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"The centre of the range of <em>L. rosalia</em> is the basin of the Rio São João, state of Rio de Janeiro. The original distribution was first clarified by Coimbra-Filho (1969, 1976) and Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier (1973, 1977). It covered the majority of the lowland coastal region of the state of Rio de Janeiro, up to 300 m asl. The easternmost record for the species is Mangaratiba, on the coast in the south-east of the state. The original distribution included all or parts of the following municipalities: Mangaratiba, Itaguai, Nova Iguaçú, Nilópolis, São João do Meriti, Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Magé, São Gonçalo, Niterói, Itaborai, Maricá, Araruama, Silva Jardim, Saquarema, Rio Bonito, Cachoeiras de Macucu, São Pedro da Aldeia, Cabo Frio, Casimiro de Abreu, Macaé, Conceição de Macabu, Campos, and São João da Barra.<br/><br/>From his surveys carried out between 1962 and 1969, Coimbra-Filho concluded that <em>L. rosalia</em> was extinct in all but seven (Silva Jardim, Cabo Frio, Saquarema, Aruarama, Casimiro de Abreu, Rio Bonito, and São Pedro da Aldeia) of the 24 municipalities of its original range. The exhaustive survey by Kierulff (1993a,b; Kierulff and Procópio de Oliveira 1996; Kierulff and Rylands 2003) which covered the entire range of the species during 18 months between 1990 and 1992, showed that they remain in only 104.5 km² of forests in three regions: 1) near the coast (the Centro Hípico de Cabo Frio, with an estimated 29 individuals, and Campos Novos, with an estimated 36 individuals); 2) the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve and adjacent forests (with an estimated 360 individuals); and 3) on the hillsides of the Serra do Mar (with an estimated 74 individuals), there largely restricted to lowland forest patches. A further nine localities contained 12 isolated groups, totalling 60 individuals. These subpopulations were registered in just four of the municipalities reported by Coimbra-Filho (1969): Silva Jardim, Cabo Frio, Saquarema, and Aruarama, the latter two, however, maintaining only a single group each (Kierulff 1993a).<br/><br/>Burity <em>et al.</em> (2007) reported the occurrence of <em>L. rosalia</em> in the municipality of Duque de Caxias, near the Rio Taquara, in the Taquara Municipal Natural Park (19,000 ha), Rio de Janeiro, a westward extension of its current known range.During 2014, the Golden Lion Tamarin Association, in collaboration with researchers from the Universidade Estadual do Norte fluminense (M de Morais and CR Ruiz-Miranda) carried out an intensive survey on the São João River watershed (covers the Biological Reserves and the Federally Protected region were 90% of the population is presumed to be) using an improved playback technique and a single-season occupancy model (MacKenzie <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). The results estimate a total population of 3400 tamarins and detected the presence of tamarins in several fragments were they had not previously been detected. The survey provided an accurate estimate of GLT occurrence over the whole region, pointing out areas of low probability of occurrence or gaps in the distribution.&#160; &#160;In 2014, the AMLD team counted an additional 106 tamarins in the Cabo Frio Municipal Park.&#160;The extent of occurrence of<em> L. rosalia</em> was calculated using the MCP (Minimum Convex Polygon) taking into account only the occupied fragments, then excluding areas with local extinction (Pissinatti A., personal communication). Therefore, the calculated extent of occurrence was 6106.23 km<sup>2 </sup>and the estimated area of occupancy was less than 500 km<sup>2</sup> (337.55 km<sup>2</sup>) (Traylor-Holzer 2006).",,Terrestrial,"Included on the Brazilian Official List of Species Threatened with Extinction (Lista Nacional Oficial de Espécies da Fauna Ameaçadas de ExtinçãoMMA, 2014), and likewise on the regional threatened species list of the state of Rio de Janeiro (Bergallo <em>et al</em>. 2000). It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.<br/>The conservation project for the golden lion tamarins has been considered successful (Kierulff<em> et al.</em>&#160;2012). The first conservation initiatives for <em>Leontopithecus rosalia </em>began with field surveys and initiation of a breeding programme for the species by Adelmar Coimbra-Fillho and Alceo Magnanani in the late 1960s (Coimbra-Filho and Magananini 1972; Magnanini and Coimbra-Filho 1972; Coimbra-Filho 1976a,b). Kleiman (1972) set up an international breeding programme and studbook for the captive populations in 1972, and initiated The Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Program (GLTCP) of the National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution, in 1983. The GLTCP, subsumed by the Brazilian NGO-the Golden Lion Tamarin Association (AMLD),-in 1993, remains active and includes field research, reintroduction, environmental education, and habitat restoration programmes. Today the conservation efforts are centred on the São João River Watershed which includes the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, created in 1972 (Magnanini 1978), the União Biological Reserve (created in 2008), and the São joão river-golden lion tamarin Federal Environmental Protection Area (created in 2002).<br/>Golden Lion Tamarins occur in the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve (5,500 ha, of which 2,760 ha is forested), União Biological Reserve (3,260 ha, of which 2,400 ha is forested), Bacia do Rio São João / Mico-leão-dourado Environmental Protection Area (150,700 ha), Petropólis Environmental Protection Area (5900 ha) (Burity <em>et al.</em> 2007,) and Taquara Municipal Natural Park (19,000 ha) (Burity <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/>The Golden Lion Tamarin Association, a Brazilian NGO, founded in 1993 has a strong and active strategic management plan for the conservation of the species in its habitat.&#160; A recent strategic planning meeting (2015) identified the key strategies for long term conservation of the species, and has a plan for forming 4 major viable populations connected as a meta-population. There is a managed population in captivity maintained at about 490 animals. There is some room for expansion for the population, but considering the extreme fragmentation there will be the need for active reforestation to increase forest connectivity. Current and future conservation efforts are attacking this problem with reforestation and the establishment of corridors.&#160; There are ongoing translocation efforts to seed a new population in the area of Lavras/Pirinueus.The small threat posed by the introduced GHLTs in Niteroi is being further reduced by the removal of these animals from the region through a collaborative project carried by the Instituto Pri-Matas, INEA (Rio de Janeiro State Environmental Institute) and ICMBio. The project has removed over 500 of these animals. Total removal is planned to end by 2016.&#160;<br/>There was an International Committee for the Conservation and Management of Lion Tamarins, set up in 1990 by the Brazilian Government (Instituto do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis&#160; of the Ministry of the Environment) (see Rambaldi <em>et al</em>. 2002).&#160; It stopped working in 2005, approximately.&#160; The Instituto Chico Mendes&#160; de Conservação da Biodiversidade (of the Ministry of the Environment) incorporated the functions of that committee within is National Action Plan for the Mammals of Central Atlantic Forest.&#160;<br/>Historical reviews of the conservation measures and programmes for the lion tamarins are provided by Rylands <em>et al</em>.

17935400,11505,Leontopithecus chrysopygus,Endangered,A3ce,2020,2020-01-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em> is considered Endangered (EN A3ce) due to an anticipated population reduction of 50% or more within the next three generations (2019-2040) due to continued habitat loss within its range, the possible loss of several subpopulations that are believed to be non-viable over the mid- to long-term, and the potential for significant losses due to stochastic events (e.g., the recent yellow fever outbreak that has caused significant mortality in the <em>L. rosalia </em>populations).","<em>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em> is endemic to the seasonal rain forest of the inland extension of Atlantic forest in the state of São Paulo, also known as semi-deciduous forest, at altitudes that range from 260 to 913 m (Valladares-Padua and Cullen Jr. 1994, Röhe<em> et al</em>. 2003). The species is not restricted to primary forests, being well able to live in modified/disturbed environments such as secondary forests, relying only on sufficient year round available resources, such as tree holes to be used as sleeping sites, and fruit trees or foraging sites (Coimbra-Filho 1969, 1976a; Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1973). Because they have long, slender fingers and modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, they are allowed to forage for prey efficiently in nooks and crannies and in epiphytic tank bromeliads (Coimbra-Filho 1970a). They are considered generalists and their diet is mainly composed by fruits, plant exudates, and small live prey, such as amphibians, lizards, birds, invertebrates and other animals (Passos 1999, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015). Commonly, within their faeces undigested seeds are found. Such seeds were proved to be viable after passing through their digestive system, characterizing them as good seed dispersers as they walk long distances—between 1 and 3 km during a day (Passos 1997b, Medici 2001). For this reason, the species is important for the maintenance of the ecosystem services of their habitat. The group home range can vary significantly, from 40 ha to almost 400 ha (Albernaz 1997, Mamede-Costa 1997, Medici 2001, Passos 1997a, Valladares-Padua 1993). It can be influenced by several factors, such as seasonal variation of resources within the same area or difference in availability of resources among different areas. It shows the importance of studying home range in each fragment that the tamarins occur, to have a better estimation of population size and the fragment’s carrying capacity. Such data can be useful for designing population management strategies.&#160;Coimbra-Filho (1970a,b, 1976a; Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1977) and Martins (2003) studied their behaviour in the wild, and Valladares-Padua (1993) provides a comprehensive review of the ecology, diet and behaviour of the black lion tamarins. The species lives in extended family groups whose size varies from 2 to 8 individuals, but on average it is 3 to 4 (Coimbra-Filho 1976a, Carvalho and Carvalho 1989). Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. They breed once a year, the pregnancy lasts between 125 and 132 days and the females usually give birth to twins.","The principal threat to<em> Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em> stems from severe habitat loss that occurred throughout its range in past decades, and which has resulted in fragmented forests and isolated sub-populations, many of which are not considered viable over the long-term (Holst <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the state of São Paulo only 6.4% (about 5,000 km²) of the Black Lion Tamarin’s tropical semi-deciduous forest habitat remains, and the species actually occurs in less than 10% of that area (490 km²) as small, scattered and isolated sub-populations (Garbino <em>et&#160; al</em>. 2016). Each forest fragment is surrounded by cattle farms and/or eucalyptus, sugar cane and coffee plantations.&#160; Ongoing threats include fire, the establishment of rural settlements, agricultural expansion, road kill and the recent emergency of yellow fever in southern regions of Brazil (Bicca-Marques <em>et al.</em> 2017, Garcia 2018). Reduced population size and deforestation in some fragments may be the cause of recent local extinctions that have been reported (Garbino <em>et al</em>. 2016). According to some scenarios, climate change may also represent a future threat by affecting the extent and/or suitability of available habitat (Meyer<em> et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em> is now known to survive in 15 localities in the state of São Paulo. However, only the subpopulation of the Morro do Diabo State Park can be considered both demographically and genetically viable in the long term. The minimum viable population estimated for the species is more than 750 individuals in a single population to meet the management goal of at least 98% chance of persistence and 98% retention of gene diversity (Holst <em>et al</em>. 2006). The population of Morro do Diabo is estimated at approximately 1,200 animals (Paranhos 2006), living in 33,845 ha of forest. The other known subpopulations, except for the recently discovered in Carlos Botelho State Park, occupy fragments smaller than 2,300 ha (most of them between 400 and 600 ha), which can harbour populations not larger than 80 animals (24 individuals on average) and are certainly too small to be viable in the mid- to long-term. The total population size is estimated at about 1,600 animals and it is inferred that the number of mature individuals is higher than 250.<br/><br/>Habitat loss continues within the Black Lion Tamarin's range and could reach between 10-15% by 2040; several of the subpopulations (representing 20% of the total population) are considered non-viable over the mid-to-long term and could be extirpated by the middle of this century, and the potential mortality due to a yellow fever outbreak could be significant, as appears to have been the case recently with <em>L. rosalia</em>.",Decreasing,"The Black Lion Tamarin is endemic to Brazil, occurring only in the Atlantic Forest of the state of São Paulo (Kierulff <em>et al.</em> 2008). Unlike the other three species of this genus, all of which reach the Atlantic coast, it is restricted to inland. It formerly occurred along the north (right) bank of the Paranapanema River, west as far as the Paraná River, and between the upper Paranapanema and Tietê (left bank) rivers in the state of São Paulo (Coimbra-Filho 1976a,b; Hershkovitz 1977). Its distribution boundaries to the east are probably altitude-limited by the higher peaks of Serra de Paranapiacaba, a large mountain range of forest remnant in which the Back Lion Tamarin’s distribution remains unknown. Nowadays, it is known from only 15 widely separated forest patches covering about 490 km², all of them within the area belonging to the Rio Paranapanema’s watershed, indicating that the current distribution of the taxon is reduced relative to its historical extent of occurrence. The black lion tamarin currently occurs in eight protected areas throughout its distribution range. In the southeast part of the state it occurs mainly in non-protected patches of gallery forest in the municipalities of Buri, Guareí and Itapeva (Lima<em> et al.</em> 2003). The recent record of the species in the Carlos Botelho State Park (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2014), confirming its presence further south in the Serra de Paranapiacaba, could mean an improvement in its demographic situation, signalling potential changes in its future conservation status. On the other hand, it points to the need of obtaining more information about this population and along the length of this mountain chain within the neighbouring protected areas. Valladares-Padua and Martins (2008) also stress the importance of further investigation in the southeastern region of the state, including population estimates. A new population assessment covering the different areas of occupancy in all its geographic range is a priority. As well as other species of <em>Leontopithecus</em>, <em>L</em>. <em>chrysopygus </em>are very difficult to monitor and easily escape the eyes of researchers and therefore the use of radio telemetry is indispensable in studies with these species.",,Terrestrial,"The isolation and the small size of existing populations are being addressed through metapopulation management, that is, the joint management of all known populations, together with the captive population treated as a single core-population (Kierulff&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). In addition to this management program (via translocations and reintroductions), current efforts are focused on research about home range, health and genetics of the in situ populations (Valladares-Padua<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2000a, Valladares-Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002a), environmental education (Padua and Valladares-Padua 1997, Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002), creation of protected areas in remaining forest fragments (with and without tamarins), and the planting of forest corridors reconnecting fragments and establishing larger areas of continuous forest that can harbor viable populations of&#160;<em>L. chrysopygus </em>(Padua and Valladares-Padua 1997; Valladares-Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000a,b; Cullen Jr.<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2001; Valladares-Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002b).<br/><br/>There is a captive breeding program going on, although it was not as successful as those of&#160;<em>L. rosalia</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>L. chrysomelas</em>, probably because of the very small founder stock, formed by individuals from the Morro do Diabo State Park in the 1970s and later in 1983-1985 as part of the rescue operation in the inundation area of the Rosana hydroelectric dam (Ballou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Rylands<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2002). However, it is growing and, despite a few founders, now this population also contributes to the metapopulation management program currently supervised by Valladares-Padua, and developed by G. Rezende and her team (Valladares-Padua and Ballou 1996; Valladares-Padua and Martins 1996; Valladares-Padua 1997; Valladares-Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000a,b; Medici 2001; Valladares-Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002a; Rezende 2014). The first translocation of a wild group of&#160;<em>L. chrysopygus</em>&#160;was held in 1995 and the first reintroduction experiment was conducted in 1999 through a combination of an adult male born in Jersey Zoo (Durrell Wildlife Park), UK, with two wild females (Valladares-Padua<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2000a,; Rezende 2014).<br/><br/>All actions being developed were listed and recommended during a Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) Workshop (Holst&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), and are presented in the National Action Plan for the Conservation of Central Atlantic Forest Mammals (PAN MAMAC - ICMBio 2010), elaborated by the Brazilian government and partners. The Black lion tamarin is especially considered in the Emergency Plan for the Conservation of Primates in the State of São Paulo that is being developed since 2014 by the official Commission for the Protection of Primates in the state of São Paulo (“Pró-Primatas Commission”), coordinated by the São Paulo state Secretary for Environment.<br/><br/>As recognition of all efforts being done for the species conservation in 2014,&#160;<em>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em>&#160;was decreed by the São Paulo state governor as the symbol species of wildlife conservation and a Natural Heritage of São Paulo state. <br/><br/><em>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em>&#160;is included on the Brazilian Official List of Species Threatened with Extinction (Lista Oficial de Espécies Brasileiras Ameaçadas de Extinção, Edict No. 1.522/19th December 1989, Bernardes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1990, Fonseca<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1994, MMA 2003, 2014), and likewise on the regional threatened species list of the state of São Paulo (SMA 1998, São Paulo 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.<br/>Other assessments:<br/><ul><li>National Red List Category from the Previous Assessment: (CR) - CR C2a(ii), E.

This species was common in the pet trade and has been released from captivity in many areas outside of its previous range - often hybridising with native <em>Callithrix</em>. Identified threats do not compromise the population as a whole, despite the loss and fragmentation of its habitat and a suspected population loss.","<em>Callithrix penicillata</em> can be found in Gallery Forest, dry forest and forest patches in the Cerrado of Central Brazil. As is true of other marmosets, they show a preference for disturbed and secondary growth forest (Fonseca and Lacher Jr. 1984; Lacher Jr. <em>et al.</em> 1984; Rylands 1984; Seabra <em>et al</em>. 1991; Rylands and Faria 1993).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet (Coimbra-Filho 1972; Rylands 1984; Rylands and Faria 1993). The most specialized of the<em> Callithrix</em> marmosets in this respect are <em>Callithrix jacchus</em> and <em>C. penicillata </em>(see Rylands 1984; Fonseca and Lacher Jr. 1984; Lacher Jr.<em> et al.</em> 1984; Rylands 1984; Rylands and Faria 1993). They live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. Associated with their tree-gouging and gum-feeding specialisation, groups generally have small home ranges: 1.25 ha to 4.5 ha (Fonseca and Lacher Jr. 1984); 3.5 ha (Faria 1986, 1989); 8.25 ha and 18.5 ha in IBGE Ecological Station (Brasília) (Miranda and Faria 1997); 2.5 ha and 6 ha in Universidade Católica de Goiás (Goiás) (Santana and Santee 1999);&#160; 6.0 ha in Universidade Católica Dom Bosco (Odalia-Rimoli and Rimoli 2007) and 50 ha in RPPN Fundação Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (Ferreira et al. 2005, Santos, 2014), both in Campo Grande (Mato Grosso do Sul). <br/><br/><em>Callithrix penicillata</em> has been the subject of a number of short studies (see, for example, Fonseca and Lacher Jr. 1984; Lacher Jr. <em>et al.</em> 1984; Faria 1984a,b, 1986, 1989; Miranda and Faria 2001; Vilela and Faria 2004; Vilela 2007).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Adult female: HB 209mm ± 9.0 (n=9) (Hershkovitz 1977); weight 307 g (n=8) (Smith and Jungers 1997).<br/>Adult male: HB 209mm ± 9.0 (n=9) (Hershkovitz 1977); weight 344 g (n=8) (Smith and Jungers 1997).","This is an adaptable, widespread species, which has been introduced in a number of regions in Brazil (for example, Espírito Santo, Paraná, São Paulo and Santa Catarina), and is considered a competitor, displacing native species. However, as with <em>C. jacchus</em>, although widespread and hardy, and able to survive in extremely degraded habitats, populations of this species have disappeared or are declining in many parts of its range. Threats include deforestation and fragmented habitat, hunting for pets, and hybridisation.","There are estimated to be more than 10,000 mature individuals. Recorded population densities: 0.40 ind/ha and 0.82 ind/ha in IBGE Ecological Reserve, Brasília (Miranda and Faria 1997); 0.43 ind/km in Rio Doce State Park, Minas Gerais (Stallings and Robinson 1991); 3.2 ind/ha&#160; in Universidade Católica de Goiás (campus II), Goiás (Santana 1999); 0.29 ind/10km in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais (Barros 2008).",Decreasing,"<em>C. penicillata </em>has a very wide distribution, occurring mainly in the Cerrado region of east central Brazil, but can also be found in Atlantic Forest and Caatinga. According to Hershkovitz (1977) and Rylands and Mednes (2008), this species is endemic to Brazil and occurs in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, the Federal District, the south-west tip of Piauí, Maranhão and the north of São Paulo, north of the Rios Tietê and Piracicaba, as a resident and native, and in the states of Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná and Santa Catarina as a resident and introduced. In the north, it would seem that it is restricted to the south of the Rio Grande and Rio São Francisco (<em>C. jacchus </em>occurring to the north of the Rio Grande), although Vivo (1991) identified two skins in the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, from the north-east coast of Maranhão, at Miritiba (now called Humberto de Campos), which he indicated extends its range right through eastern Maranhão, along the left bank of the Rio Parnaiba. The large gap between the next northern most locality to the south (Canabrava, Rio Tocantins, Goiás, locality 275a of Hershkovitz 1977, p.490) and this northern Maranhão locality, indicates that they were probably introduced animals. They were not located by Hershkovitz (1977) and were presumed by him to be <em>C. jacchus,</em> following Ávila-Pires (1969). Silva Jr. (1999) carried out surveys in Maranhão and Piauí and did not report the occurrence of <em>C. penicillata, </em>only <em>C. jacchus. </em>The western limits of its range would seem to be marked by the Rio Araguaia, south from around 8ºS in the region of the Serra das Cordilheiras, extending into the north-east of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, east of the Serra de Maracaju to the level of the Rios Pardo or Taquaraçú, west (right) bank tributaries of the Rio Paraná.<br/><br/>Surveys in the north of the state of Minas Gerais have shown that <em>C. penicillata </em>extends its range through the region between the upper Rio São Francisco and the Rio Jequitinhonha, along the western slopes of the Serra do Espinhaço. <em>C. penicillata </em>occurs both sides of the Rio Jequitinhonha as far east as the Rio Araçuaí, a south (right) bank tributary of the upper Jequitinhonha, beyond which it is restricted to the north of the river, with<em> C. geoffroyi </em>occurring to the south (Rylands <em>et al. </em>1988), the result of a recent introduction (<em>ca. </em>1975) in the vicinity of Belmonte (Coimbra-Filho unpubl. data). <em>Callithrix penicillata</em> is typically of the Cerrado region of Minas Gerais (in the central, south-west, west, and north of the state). Those parts originally covered by Atlantic Forest in the east and south-east (Zona da Mata) are the domain of <em>C. geoffroyi, C. flaviceps, </em>and in part of the Rio Doce valley, <em>C. aurita. </em>However, with the destruction of the forest and also introductions arising from misguided release of confiscated animals,<em> C. penicillata </em>is taking a hold and probably replacing other species in numerous localities east and south of its original range (see, for example, Olmos and Martuscelli 1995). This is happening in the Rio Doce State Park, and is possibly also the case of<em> C. penicillata </em>reported by Vivo (1991; see also Coimbra-Filho 1984) from the Itatiaia National Park straddling the border of the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. In both cases,<em> C. aurita </em>is the species naturally occurring in the area.<br/>The current distribution of the taxon is probably reduced in relation to its historical range due to habitat loss, especially in the Cerrado. Its extent of occurrence is greater than 20,000 km² and its area of occupancy greater than 2,000 km².<em><br/><br/></em>",Hunting for pets exists for this species.,Terrestrial,"<em>C. penicillata </em>has been introduced into protected areas in the state of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina and São Paulo.

It is very adaptable, being able to live in urban parks and gardens and rural villages where it is not persecuted and has sufficient food. It has been introduced into many areas outside of its natural range, where it is able to thrive and is believed to compete with and displace other (native) marmosets.<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet (Coimbra-Filho 1972; Rylands 1994). They live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season.  <br/><br/><em>Callithrix jacchus</em> is a gum-feeding specialist, with gouging lower incisors to excavate holes in gum-producing trees to guarantee gum year-round. This allows it to live in very seasonal habitats, including deciduous forests and scrub in the north-east of Brazil. Associated with its specialisation in gum-feeding, it defends home ranges that are much smaller than are typical of the genus: 0.72 to 5.2 ha. Castro (2003) recorded home ranges of 0.3 to 2.4 ha at Níisia Floresta National Forest, Rio Grande do Norte. Maier <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Alonso and Llangguth (1989) recorded home ranges of 2-5 ha in the urban district of João Pessoa, Paraíba, and Mendes Pontes and Monteiro da Cruz (1995) of 4 ha in an urban park in Recife, Pernambuco. Group sizes have been recorded to range from 2 to 15 at the Tapacurá State Ecological Station, Pernambuco (Hubrecht 1985; Scanlon <em>et al</em>. 1988). Usually one female breeds in each group. Twins are produced twice a year.","Although widespread and common in many localities, and even replacing other <em>Callithrix</em> species where it has been introduced, <em>C. jacchus</em> populations are declining through habitat destruction in many parts of their distribution (Mittermeier<em> et al.</em> 1988; Coimbra-Filho 1984). There is some limited hunting for pets. However, harvesting and the current rate of decline and are not sufficient to qualify it for, or near for, a threatened category.","<em>Callithrix jacchus</em> can occur in very high densities. Total remaining population is not known, but it was estimated that the number of mature individuals of this taxon is greater than 10,000. The groups range in size from 3-15 individuals but usually have an average of nine members (Monteiro da Cruz 1998; Alonso and Langguth 1989): 8.7 ± 2.7 (n=18) (Koenig 1995); 8.5 ± 3.3 (n=4) (Mendes-Pontes and Monteiro da Cruz 1995); 6.4 ± 2.2 (n=10) (Digby and Barreto 1996); 10.6 ± 2.5 (n=7) (Arruda <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/>Density estimates:Ceará: 1 ind./ha – Campus Universitário do Pici (Da Silva 1999);&#160;Rio Grande do Norte: 0.85-1.6 ind./ha –Nísia Floresta National Forest (Castro 2003);&#160;Pernambuco 1.1-1.5 ind./ha – Ipojuca (Verissimo and Oliveira 2007);&#160;Paraíba: 9.5 groups/km2 - RPPN Engenho Gargaú, Santa Rita (Fialho and Gonçalves, 2008).Rio de Janeiro: 0.09 ind./ha – Rio Bonito (Ruiz-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2000).",Decreasing,"The Common Marmoset occurs in the scrub forest (forest patches in dry caatinga thorn scrub) and Atlantic Forest of north-eastern Brazil, in the states of Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Piauí, where it is endemic, originally extending south as far as the Rio São Francisco and its west (left) bank tributary the Rio Grande (about 11º30’S). Hershkovitz (1977) indicated that it also probably extends north-west into the state of Maranhão, to the left bank of the Rio Parnaíba and the Serra do Valentim (Hershkovitz 1977). Hershkovitz (1977) extended&#160; the distribution no further west than the middle reaches of the Rio Grande (left bank) and the upper Rio Parnaíba (right bank), with a lacuna between these points and the Rio Tocantins. Silva Jr. (1999) reported on localities in Maranhão and Piauí marking the north-western limit to its range, and determined that, as Hershkovitz (1977) had indicated, it extends to the left bank of the Rio Parnaíba, but there is a lack of information concerning its occurrence or otherwise west from there into the basin of the Rio Itapecuru (Silva Jr. 1999). Flesher (2001) recorded <em>C. jacchus</em> in the Serra das Mangabeiras at the headwaters of the Rio Parnaíba in Piauí, approximately 10ºS, 46ºW. South of the Serra da Mangabeiras, it is possible that the Serra Geral de Goiás marks the divide with <em>C. penicillata</em> to the west.&#160;<br/>It has spread into numerous other regions as a result of introductions outside of its original range, south of the Rio São Francisco, accompanying the destruction and degradation of the Atlantic coastal forest and its associated ecosystems (Coimbra-Filho and Câmara 1996). Introduced and recent populations include those in the state of Sergipe and the north and north-east of Bahia, including the Recôncavo Baiano (Alonso<em> et al</em>. 1987), the state of Rio de Janeiro (Coimbra-Filho, 1984; Ruiz-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2000) and the Ilha de Santa Catarina in southern Brazil (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2005) and they are also reported to have established themselves in Buenos Aires.

(1991/1992; Coimbra-Filho and Câmara 1996) have shown that this region was originally forested, and argued that the destruction of the natural vegetation over vast areas since the European discovery of Brazil in 1500, along with frequent and repeated introductions, certainly of <em>C. jacchus </em>but probably also of <em>C. penicillata</em>, has resulted in a confused picture of hybrids between these species and between <em>C. penicillata</em> and <em>C. kuhlii</em> (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> 1993). They argued that pure <em>C. kuhlii</em> was the original form occurring there.<br/>The extent of occurrence of <em>C. jacchus</em> is greater than 20,000 km²,&#160;and its estimated area of occupancy larger than 2,000&#160;km².",,Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES.

Also known to use cabruca (cacao) plantations which are shaded with some native trees remaining from the original forest. They have been observed in secondary growth forest in abandoned rubber plantations. <em>Callithix kuhlii</em> is an adaptable species well able to live in degraded and secondary forests, depending on sufficient year round food sources and foraging sites. Near the coast, in the cocoa growing region, there is no distinct dry season with rainfall exceeding 2,000 mm per year (the heaviest rains are from March to June), but in the West of their range the forests are mesophytic with a distinct dry season. In some areas of its distribution the forests are semi deciduous, with rainfall as low as 1,000 mm per year (Rylands 1989, Pinto and Rylands 1997).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births.

They live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals. Rylands (1982) observed groups sizes of 5 to 9 individuals (mean 6.56 ± 1.33, n=8). Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. The groups defend home ranges of 10-40 ha, depending on the availability and distribution of food items and secondary-growth patches. Rylands (1982, 1989) recorded a home range size of 12 ha for a group of five individuals.<br/><br/>Rylands (1982, 1984, 1989) studied the behaviour and ecology of <em>C. kuhlii</em>&#160;at the Lemos Maia Experimental Station, Una, Bahia. Raboy and Dietz (2000) and Raboy <em>et al</em>. (2006) also studied this species in the Una Biological Reserve.","The main threat to <em>Callithrix kuhlii</em> is habitat loss and forest fragmentation, mainly due to the conversion of forest areas to cattle ranch and extensive agriculture, especially in the western part of the species range where cattle ranches predominate and forest fragmentation is most severe (Neves 2008, Pereira 2015).&#160; According to Global Forest Watch data, rates of forest loss in both Bahia and Minas Gerais have accelerated in recent years and could result in losses of suitable habitat on the order of 15%-20% deforestation over the course of three generations (2013-2031).&#160; Hybridization with invasive species of <em>Callithrix </em>(<em>C. jacchus</em> and <em>C. penicillata</em>) represents an increasing menace. The species is also captured for the pet trade and suffers mortality from road accidents and electrocutions.","The total remaining population is not known, but, due to the species' range and its presence in some relatively large protected areas, it is suspected to be more than 10,000 mature individuals (Pereira 2015). Population densities recorded from the Lemos Maia Experimental Station (CEPLAC/CEPEC), Una, Bahia, were 8.70-9.7 groups/km² or 50.00-68.06 individuals/km² (Rylands 1982).<br/><br/>The population is declining. A reduction of at least 30% over three generations (18 years) is suspected based on accelerated forest loss that has impacted the most recent generation (2013-2018) and is likely to result in an overall 20% loss of suitable habitat over the the course of the next two generations (2019-2025; 2026-2031), combined with ongoing capture of this species for the pet trade, and hybridization with at least two other <em>Callithrix</em> species.",Decreasing,"Endemic to Brazil, <em>Callithrix kuhlii</em> occurs between Rio de Contas and Rio Jequitinhonha in southern Bahia, just entering the north-easternmost tip of the state of Minas Gerais (Santos <em>et al</em>. 1987, Rylands<em> et al</em>. 1988, Neves 2008). The western boundary is still uncertain, but undoubtedly related to the inland limits of the Atlantic coastal forest. I.B. Santos (in Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1988) observed hybrids of <em>C. penicillata</em> and <em>C. kuhlii</em> in the region of Almenara, Minas Gerais, on the left bank of the Rio Jequitinhonha (16°41’S, 40°51’W). Neves (2008) surveyed the distribution of <em>C. kuhlii</em> and found individuals with hybrid phenotypes in 13 localities with dense tropical rain forest, at the western boundary of the species range, suggesting that the species is losing area to <em>C. penicillata</em> in this region (Neves 2008, Pereira 2015). Its range is largely coincident with that of the golden-headed lion tamarin <em>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</em> and these two callitrichids are broadly sympatric.<br/>Surveys in 1986/1987 by Oliver and Santos (1991) demonstrated the presence of forms intermediate in appearance between <em>C. kuhlii</em> and <em>C. penicillata</em> north of the Rio de Contas, along the coast up to the regions of Valença and Nazaré, just south of the city of Salvador (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 1988). Individuals observed by Rylands near to Nazaré lacked the white frontal blaze, and, although retaining the pale cheek patches typical of <em>kuhlii</em>, were paler grey. A photograph of the marmoset from Valença, Bahia, north of the Rio de Contas, is shown in Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. (1988, p.19). The variation in pelage colour of the marmosets in this region is considerable, but Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> (1991/1992) showed that true <em>C. kuhlii</em> extended north through coastal Bahia into the state of Sergipe as far as the Rio São Francisco. The present-day confusion has arisen from the widespread forest destruction, even more intense north of Salvador City, and the introduction and invasion of <em>C. jacchus</em> and <em>C. penicillata</em>.",Maintaining this species in captivity or semi-captive as pets is common within the species range (Neves 2008).

White-faced marmoset inhabits a great variety of habitats, including dense forest, semideciduous forest of the Atlantic Forest biome and deciduous forest in the Caatinga biome (the northern distribution reachs the Jequitinhonha Valley) (Rylands <em>et al.</em> 1988, Passamani 1996). The taxon is not restricted to primary habitats (Rylands and Mendes 2008a), and is tolerant to changes / disturbances in the environment, occurring in forest fragments immersed in eucalyptus monoculture matrix (Passamani 1996, 1998, Passamani and Rylands 2000a,b). Therefore, it can be considered a species very adapted to antropic environments (Rylands and Mendes 2008a).<br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births.

Although considered an adaptable species, populations are declining because of widespread destruction of the Atlantic forest in the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo. Less than 6.8% of the original area of Atlantic forest remains in the state of Minas Gerais (da Fonseca 1985). Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> (1982) and Coimbra-Filho (1986c) recommended that this species be considered endangered, but Oliver and Santos (1991) found that although it was patchily distributed, it remained locally abundant, and concluded that the species is not seriously threatened at the present time. It is occasionally hunted for pets.","Chiarello (1995) recorded a density of 10.5 groups/km² and a total population of about 1,644 individuals in the Linhares Forest Reserve (21,800 ha) of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, in northern Espírito Santo, Brazil. Subsequently, Chiarello (1999) surveyed <em>Callithrix geoffroyi</em> in a number of areas in the state of Espírito Santo. In the Sooretama Biological Reserve (24,250 ha) he recorded encounter rates of 1.81 groups/10 km, and in the Linhares Forest Reserve, 2.16 groups/10 km. Densities were lower in the smaller forests of the Córrego do Veado Biological reserve (2,400 ha) and Córrego Grande Biological Reserve (1,504 ha), at 1.05 groups/10 km and 0.15 groups/10 km, respectively.<br/>The total population size is not known, but it is inferred that the number of mature individuals is greater than 10,000. White-faced marmoset has an average size group ranging from 3 individuals, as observed in Aracruz Celulose SA (ES) by Passamani and Rylands (2000a), to 10 individuals as it was observed in Morro do Pilar (MG) by Oliveira <em>et al. </em>(2003).",Decreasing,"Geoffroy’s Marmoset occurs in the state of Espírito Santo and the forested eastern and north-eastern part of Minas Gerais, north as far as the Rios Jequitinhonha and Araçuaí and south to near the state border of Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro (Ávila-Pires 1969, Hershkovitz 1977, Coimbra-Filho 1984, Rylands<em> et al.</em> 1988). The populations just south of the Rio Jequitinhonha resulted from animals released near its mouth, at Belmonte, around 1975 (Coimbra-Filho 1986c). From there it spread eastward, and today also occurs in gallery forests throughout the region of dry thorn scrub (<em>caatinga</em>) of the middle reaches of the river (Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1988). Vivo (1991) limits it to the east of the Serra do Espinhaço in Minas Gerais. It has been recorded from the eastern slopes of Serra do Cipó, a southerly section of the Serra do Espinhaço range, at an altitude of 1,274 m (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2003). Hybrid populations of <em>C. penicillata</em> and <em>C. geoffroyi</em> have been observed in some parts of the Serra da Piedade along the Rio Piracicaba, affluent of the upper Rio Doce, where the Atlantic coastal forest gives way to the cerrado (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al</em>. 1993, Passamani <em>et al</em>. 1997). The range of <em>C. geoffroyi</em> overlaps with <em>C. flaviceps</em> (see below) in southern Espírito Santo (south of the Rio Doce) and south-eastern Minas Gerais. However, <em>C. geoffroyi</em> is generally restricted to lowland areas, below 500–700 m, and<em> C. flaviceps</em> to altitudes above 400–500 m (Coimbra-Filho 1971, Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> 1981). Hershkovitz (1977) asserted that the highest recorded locality for <em>C. geoffroyi</em> is Santa Teresa, 659 m asl, but Mendes (1993, 1997a) has observed mixed bands of <em>C. geoffroyi </em>and <em>C. flaviceps</em> at altitudes of 800 m.

17936805,3571,Callithrix flaviceps,Critically Endangered,A2ace,2020,2019-07-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Callithrix flaviceps</em> is considered Critically Endangered (CR A2ae) due a suspected population reduction experienced over the last three generations (18 years), due in large part to declining habitat, the effects of introduced conspecifics (e.g., hybridization) and a yellow fever epidemic reportedly reducing at least one of the more significant subpopulations by 90%. In addition,&#160;the total population is estimated at 4,440 individuals, with the total number of mature individuals below 2,500. It is unlikely that any subpopulation possesses more than 250 mature individuals.","<em>Callithrix aurita </em>and <em>C. flaviceps </em>are the southernmost forms of marmosets in terms of the natural range of the genus (<em>C. jacchus, C. penicillata </em>and <em>C. geoffroyi </em>have been introduced further south in Paraná, São Paulo, Santa Catarina and Argentina). They occur in the montane Atlantic coastal forest and forests of the inland plateau, at altitudes up to 1,200 m where dry season temperatures can fall close to freezing (Ferrari <em>et al. </em>1996). They show a preference for disturbed forest, being rare in old growth forest with sparse understoreys (Ferrari 1988; Ferrari and Mendes 1991). There is a natural hybrid zone, with <em>Callithrix aurita, </em>at the Serra do Brigadeiro, Carangola, in south-eastern Minas Gerais (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al. </em>1993; Cosenza 1993; Mendes 1997a; Cosenza and Melo 1998).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex), fungi and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects) (see Ferrari 1988, 1991; Corrêa<em> et al. </em>2000; Hilário and Ferrari 2010a). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of their diet (Coimbra-Filho 1972; Rylands 1984). Nevertheless, <em>C. flaviceps </em>rarely gouge trees in order to stimulate exudate production and feed primarily on exudates already available in the environment (Ferrari 1991; Hilário and Ferrari 2010a). They live in extended family groups of 3 to 20 individuals (Alves 1986; Ferrari 1991; Ferrari and Digby 1996; Guimarães 1998; Hilário and Ferrari 2010a). Reproduction is concentrated at one dominant female, although up to four females can reproduce simultaneously in on group (Ferrari 1991; Guiarães 1998; Hilário and Ferrari 2010b).<em> C. flaviceps </em>groups present weak territoriality and occupy large home ranges (33.9 -138.3 ha) compared to other congeneric species (Ferrari 1991; Guiarães 1998; Hilário 2009).<br/><br/>The ecology and behaviour of <em>C. flaviceps </em>has been studied by Ferrari (1988, 1991, Ferrari and Diego 1992) at the 880 ha Caratinga Biological Station in Minas Gerais. The home range of the group he studied was 35.5 ha. Guimarães (1998a, 1998b) also studied the same marmoset group at Caratinga. Latter, Hilário (2009, Hilário and Ferrari 2010a) studied the ecology and behavior of a free ranging group at the Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (3,589 ha) in Espírito Santo.<br/><br/>The dentition of <em>Callithrix flaviceps </em>is less specialized for tree-gouging to obtain gum than it is in <em>C. jacchus </em>and <em>C. penicillata </em>(see Natori 1986). Nevertheless, at Caratinga Biological Station gum is an important part of the diet year round, and largely obtained from sites where it is available without requiring gouging (Ferrari 1988, 1991; Ferrari<em> et al. </em>1996). At Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve, however, <em>C. flaviceps </em>feeds predominantly on fungi and small animals, with gum representing only 3% of the group’s diet (Hilário and Ferrari 2010a).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Average weight: 406 g (Rosenberger 1992).","<em>Callithrix flaviceps </em>has a restricted range in an area where the forest is extremely fragmented due to expanding agriculture, cattle ranching, tree plantations (Eucalyptus), urbanization, mining and dam construction (Coimbra-Filho 1986a; 1990; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Mendes and Melo 2007; pers. obs.). The species is also captured live for the local&#160; pet trade.<br/><br/>Mendes and Melo (2007) surveyed forest fragments in the Zona da Mata of the state of Minas Gerais, and recorded the presence of introduced populations of <em>Callithrix jacchus</em>, <em>C. peniciilata</em> and <em>C. geoffroyi</em>, which they believe are displacing <em>C. flaviceps</em>. They recommended awareness campaigns to reduce the habit of releasing marmosets in the forests surrounding the town of Manhuaçú.<br/>Comparison of census data spanning three generations (2005-2019), a yellow fever epidemic appears to be largely responsible for a 90% population decline in at least one major sub-population (Possamai <em>et al</em>. 2019) and may have impacted others as well (S. Mendes, pers. comm. 2019).<br/><strong><em></em></strong>","Their distribution is locally patchy, being abundant in some areas, but rare or absent in others close by. A past population decline of at least 90% is suspected due habitat degradation, extraction for the pet trade, and yellow fever.<br/><br/>In Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve, Espírito Santo, Pinto<em> et al. </em>(1993) recorded a mean density of 7.1 individuals/km² (range = 3.4-18 individuals/km²) and Hilário (2009) recorded a density of 15.4 individuals/km². At the Caratinga Biological Station, Minas Gerais, the recorded densities were 40 individuals/km² (Ferrari 1988) and 13 individuals/km2 (Almeida-Silva <em>et al. </em>2005). In a conservative approach using the smallest density reported for the species, we estimate a total population of 4,440, consisting of less than 2,500 mature individuals (ICMBio 2018). Considering the highly fragmented landscape in which <em>C. flaviceps </em>occurs, it is also unlikely that any subpopulation possesses more than 250 mature individuals.<br/><br/>A recent survey data from RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala (Possamai <em>et al</em>. 2019) documents a 90% population decline since 2005, due in large part to a yellow fever epidemic. This may be the case throughout the species' range. In addition, habitat loss is occurring across the species range and it is extracted from the wild for the pet trade.",Decreasing,"The distribution of <em>Callithrix flaviceps</em> is described by Hershkovitz (1977), Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> (1981), and Coimbra-Filho (1986a). It occurs in the Serra da Mantiqueira in southern Espírito Santo, south of the Rio Doce at least to the state boundary with Rio de Janeiro (and in the past possibly in the north of the state of Rio de Janeiro, in the municipalities of Natividade, Porciuncula and the north of Bom Jesus do Itabapoãna when they were forested). It extends west into eastern Minas Gerais in scattered localities in the highly fragmented forests of the Rio Manhuaçu basin as far as Manhuaçú (40°02’W), as noted by Coimbra-Filho (1986a) Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> (1981) and Mendes and Melo (2007). Ferrari and Mendes (1991) and Mendes (1993) reviewed the distribution of <em>C. flaviceps</em>. Hirsch (2003) obtained records in Minas Gerais which have extended its known range somewhat north and west, towards the east (right bank) of the Rio Doce (Fazenda Saet [19º43'S, 42º26'] and the Fazenda do Eraldo A. Alves [19º45'S, 42º25'] both at an altitiude of 270 m and about 10 km from the east bank of the Rio Doce, in the municipality of Pingo d’Água). Hirsch (2003) also refers to two localities which would extend the range a little further south in Minas Gerais, but they have still to be confirmed and may be hybrids with <em>C. aurita</em> (the left bank of the Rio Matipó, municipality of Abre Campo, and the Córrego Jurumirim, left bank of the Rio Casca, municipality of Rio Casca).<br/><br/>In 2011 an individual of <em>C. flaviceps</em> was collected at the municipality of Varre-Sai, in the northernmost part of the state of Rio de Janeiro. However, a larger investigation is necessary to confirm the presence of the species in this state (Oliveira and Grelle 2012).<br/><br/>It is suspected that both extent of occurrence and area of occupancy for this species are in decline due habitat degradation.",This species is live captured for the pet trade.,Terrestrial,"This species occurs in the following protected areas:<br/><br/>Minas Gerais<br/>Caparaó National Park (31,853 ha) (part Espírito Santo)<br/>Caratinga Biological Station / RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala (900 ha) (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> 1981).<br/>RPPN Mata do Sossego Biological Station (221 ha) (privately owned)<br/><br/>Espírito Santo<br/>Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (4,492 ha) (Pinto <em>et al</em>. 1993)<br/>Pedra Azul State Reserve (993 ha) (Mendes 1991; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991)<br/>Forno Grande State Reserve (340 ha) (Mendes 1991; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991)<br/>São Lourenço Biological Station (Mendes 1991; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991)  <br/>Santa Lucia Biological Station (350 ha) (Mendes 1991; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991)<br/>Montes Verdes Florest Reserve (1500 ha)(privately owned) (Mendes 1991).<br/><br/>Attempts to establish a captive breeding program have to date been unsuccessful (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
17937016,3564,Callimico goeldii,Vulnerable,A4c,2020,2020-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Callimico goeldii</em> is considered VU A4c based upon a suspected population decline of 30% or more over the course of 18 years (three generations; 2018-2036). The species appears to be only sparsely distributed over its known range, which includes four of the world's top seven countries in terms of current rates of tropical forest loss: Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. In addition, presence/absence surveys suggest that it is sympatric in 12% or less of tropical sites surveyed for other Neotropical mammals.&#160; Furthermore, less than half of the forests in which <em>Callimico</em> is found are protected.&#160; Increased forest loss within this species' range is likely to be driven by human population expansion, road construction projects, slash-and-burn agriculture, timber harvesting and artisanal gold mining.","<p> Occurs in forest mixed with bamboo, and in&#160;varillales&#160;(large stands of thin, straight trees).&#160;Izawa (1979), Buchanan-Smith (1991a), and Ferrari&#160;et al.&#160;(1999) have indicated that it is a habitat specialist concentrating on bamboo forests and disturbed forests (secondary growth) related to their tendency to spend much of their time in the lowest parts the forest&#160;understorey&#160;in dense vegetation. They can also be found in more open, mature forest (Christen and&#160;Geissmann&#160;1994; Christen 1998, 1999). Porter (2007) quantified the time a group spent in different habitat types during the course of a year: primary forest with dense&#160;understorey&#160;76%; bamboo forest 10%; secondary forest 3%. The group used bamboo forest more than the sympatric tamarins&#160;(<em>L.&#160;fuscicollis&#160;and&#160;S.&#160;labiatus</em>). Its preference for dense vegetation is related to the extraordinary inclusion of fungi in its diet and to its insect foraging&#160;behaviour. Bamboo, stream edge, and tree falls are where they are able to find the jelly fungi and bamboo fungi that they appreciate (Pook&#160;and&#160;Pook&#160;1981; Porter and Christen 2002; Porter, 2007; Porter&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007).&#160;<br/> <br/> The diet of&#160;<em>Callimico&#160;</em>includes fruit, arthropods (especially&#160;orthopterans&#160;and stick insects), fungi, and exudates. Porter (2007; Porter and Christen 2002; see also Hanson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006) found that fungi were an essential and considerable component of the diet. Two types were eaten: jelly fungi (<em>Auricularia</em>, 3 species) and bamboo fungi (<em>Ascopolyporous</em>, 2 species). In some months (May-July, dry season) fungi accounted for 48-63% of the feeding records.&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;forages for arthropods in the understorey&#160;and beneath the leaf litter on the forest floor. They are&#160;understorey&#160;specialists spending 84% of their time foraging below 5 m above the ground (saddleback&#160;tamarins&#160;tend to forage more a little higher, up to 10 m above the ground, and the moustached&#160;tamarins&#160;forage even higher up, mostly in the middle and lower canopy - above 10 m (Yoneda&#160;1981; Buchanan-Smith 1999; Porter 2007)).&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;tends to eat more vertebrates (frogs and lizards) than the&#160;tamarins. For a review see Heltne&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1981).&#160;<br/> <br/> In her long-term study of&#160;<em>Callimico</em>, Porter found that one group used an area of 114 ha, covering the entire home ranges of six&#160;tamarin&#160;groups (Porter 2007; Porter&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;Rehg&#160;(2003, 2007) on the other hand, found her&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;group using a range of about 59 ha; similar in size to the&#160;<em>Saguinus&#160;labiatus&#160;</em>group which they travelled with for about 67% of the time.&#160;Group size was 7 (six adults and&#160;subadults&#160;and an infant).&#160;<em>Callimico</em>&#160;groups can be as large as 12 (Encarnación&#160;and Heymann 1998) and unlike other&#160;callitrichids&#160;can have more than one breeding female (Masataka&#160;1981a, 1981b). Copulations occur as soon as 10 days after the female gives birth indicating post-partum&#160;oestrus. They produce single offspring. Other members of the group help carry the young (communal breeding), with the first transfer from the mother a few days (4-11) after birth.&#160;<br/> <br/> <em>Callimico</em>&#160;travels and forages with saddleback&#160;tamarins&#160;(<em>Leontocebus fuscicollis</em>) and&#160;moustached&#160;tamarins&#160;(<em>Saguinus&#160;mystax</em>,&#160;<em>Saguinus&#160;labiatus</em>, and&#160;<em>Saguinus imperator</em>) (Pook&#160;and&#160;Pook&#160;1979a, b, 1981, 1982a). Lopes and&#160;Rehg&#160;(2003) recorded <em>Callimico</em>&#160;associating with&#160;<em>S. imperator</em>&#160;in the Serra do Divisor National Park, Brazil.&#160;Rehg&#160;(2003, 2006), Watsa <em>et al</em>. observed <em>Callimico</em> with <em>L. fuscicollis</em> and <em>S. imperator</em> at the Los Amigos Conservation Concession, Peru, from 2009-2011 (2012), and Porter (2001, 2007) studied the associations between&#160;<em>Callimico</em>,&#160;<em>Saguinus&#160;labiatus</em>, and&#160;<em>L.&#160;fuscicollis&#160;weddelli</em>&#160;in south-eastern Acre, Brazil, and north-western Pando, Bolivia, respectively. Porter (2007) reviews in detail the different specializations of&#160;<em>Callimico</em>, saddleback&#160;tamarins&#160;and&#160;moustached&#160;tamarins&#160;that allow for their&#160;sympatry.</p> <p> Of the&#160;callitrichids, <em>Callimico</em> is the strongest leaper and has the most evident anatomical adaptations for vertical clinging and leaping between small trees, large tree trunks, and lianas at very low heights (4-5m above the forest floor) (Rylands and Mittermeier 2013).<br/> <br/> Size:<br/> Adult males 366 g (n=3) (Encarnación&#160;and Heymann 1998)<br/> Adult females 355 g (n=5) (Encarnación&#160;and Heymann 1998)<br/> These are wild specimens.

Median body weight 473 g (n=10, range 420-543 g) (Dettling&#160;and Pryce 1999).</p>","<p> Over 75% of the species’ distribution falls within Peru. A comprehensive review of all mammal survey data recorded sightings of <em>Callimico </em>in only 37 of 340 sites surveyed (10.9%), of which only 29 sites involved sightings of <em>Callimico</em> in the wild (not as pets or during captures). These sites are spread throughout the country, encompassing the vast majority of its lowland forests (Watsa <em>et al.</em> 2012). At the time of this evaluation, protection of any kind was available only to half of the 37 sites at which the animal was found, and this includes a very broad definition of “governmental protection”.&#160; <em>Callimico </em>has only been verified in six localities in Peru in the decade before this study was completed (Watsa <em>et al</em>. 2012) - Tahuamanu, Yurua River, Sierra del Divisor, Manu National Park, and two sites within its buffer zone (Manu Wilderness Center and Los Amigos Conservation Concession). In Manu National Park, the most heavily studied site of all with a specific focus on long-term studies of callitrichine primates, there have only been two sets of sightings. These were separated by 15 years and were of a single animal in the same bamboo stand. Intensive searching subsequently has not produced further sightings.</p> <p> Of the 6 sites in which <em>Callimico</em> was reported within a decade of this study, only two are now protected, one of which (the Sierra del Divisor) was only named a national park in 2015. The remaining areas face grave threats. The Los Amigos and Tahuamanu sites are adjacent to the Interoceanic Highway, which has spurred increasing deforestation and development along its course – both legal and illegal (Delgado 2008, Asner<em> et al.</em> 2010, Gallice <em>et al</em>. 2017). The Manu Wilderness Center, Los Amigos, Manu National Park and Tahuamanu also face a rapid and ever-increasing threat of deforestation due to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). The Madre de Dios exports ~70% of Peru’s ASGM gold production (Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2011), and a 400% increase in deforestation due to ASGM occurred between 1999-2012 (Asner<em> et al.</em> 2013). From 2006 to 2009, approximately 20 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Amazon forest was cleared each year for ASGM, and deforestation caused by ASGM went from 5,350 acres per year before 2008 to 15,180 acres each year after the 2008 global financial crisis (Daley 2016). ASGM also uses mercury, an environmental pollutant that has been detected in unsafe levels both in human and animal populations in the region (Moreno-Brush <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018; Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p> <p> In Brazil and Peru the Interoceanic highway intersects the southern end of the geographic range of <em>Callimico goeldii</em> and has led to major deforestation along its path.  The highway, which runs just north and west of the border with Bolivia, is in the same region in which <em>Callimico goeldii</em> have been reported to be at high densities (Porter 2006), and where multiple observations of the species have been made (Watsa<em> et al.</em> 2012).  The extent to which this asphalt highway has impacted <em>Callimico goeldii</em> populations has not been quantified, but it is likely to be severe. Populations in eastern Peru and western Brazil which are not located near major highways are likely to be more protected from anthropogenic disturbance.  However, as it is likely there are genetically distinct populations of <em>Callimico </em>across its range, the southern populations deserved increased protection.</p> <p><a name=""_Hlk491035251""></a> In Bolivia, <em>Callimico goeldii</em> are restricted to the Department of Pando.  The Pando has the fastest human population growth in Bolivia and the capitol city of Cobija is the fastest growing city in the country (INE 2013).  As a result, deforestation in the Pando is leading to the loss of habitat for <em>Callimico goeldii</em>. Plans have been approved to create a new highway to connect Cobija to La Paz via a new north-south road, and to pave an existing dirt road to connect Cobija to Extrema, Peru. These roads will further accelerate the destruction of forests in the northwestern region of the Pando. Bamboo often reforests areas that have been cleared for agriculture or pasture. Studies are needed to determine&#160;<em>Callimico</em>'s&#160;degree of tolerance for habitat disturbance in its range (Porter 2007).  </p> <p> In Colombia, the arc of deforestation growing from the Andes foothills to the east into the lowland forest, has reached areas as far as La Paya National Park, and the lower Caguán River, extending to the north and north-east towards Serranía de Chiribiquete National Park. Deforestation has indeed affected numerous areas of La Paya National Park, where historically, illegal crops and timber extraction have also been a driver of deforestation.  </p>","<p> This species has a very localized and patchy distribution. It is always rare and difficult to observe.&#160;Groups are generally widely separated, determined by the availability of the right mix/mosaic of habitats and food availability. Key habitat such as stream edge, bamboo forest and secondary growth patches are needed due to their predilection for certain species of fungus.<br/><br/>It is suspected that a population decline of 30% or more over the course of 18 years (three generations; 2018-3036) will occur due to the threats faced by the species. Presence/absence surveys suggest that it is sympatric in 12% or less of tropical sites surveyed for other Neotropical mammals.<br/><br/>Recorded population density estimates in Bolivia, include:&#160;0.29 groups/km² (Izawa and&#160;Yoneda&#160;1981); 0.25 groups/km² (Pook&#160;and&#160;Pook&#160;1981); 9.6 individuals/km² (Cameron&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1989); and 6.1 individuals/km² (Porter 2007).<br/><br/>Rehg&#160;(2003, 2007) recorded 0.8-1.2 groups/km² in an 820-ha forest patch in Acre, Brazil. This is higher than density estimates recorded from Bolivia, and&#160;Rehg&#160;(2007) believed it might be related to habitat heterogeneity, including disturbance associated with tree falls.<br/> <br/> Porter (2007) combined all group counts reported in the literature and calculated an average group size of 6.4 individuals, and a general population density&#160;of 5.6 individuals/km²&#160;where they occur. At one site in the far north-west of Bolivia, Porter (2007) estimated&#160;37 individuals/km².<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Callimico goeldii</em> occurs in the upper Amazon from the Rio Caquetá in Colombia, south through the Peruvian Amazon and the extreme western Amazon of Brazil into the Pando region of northern Bolivia (Hernández-Camacho and Barriga-Bonilla 1966, Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976, Hershkovitz 1977). Hershkovitz (1977) predicted that it should occur in the Ecuadorian Amazon, but it has not been found there to date. Despite its wide range, <em>Callimico </em>is notoriously patchy in its distribution and is evidently absent over a large part of it.<br/><br/>In Colombia, it occurs from the base of the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes in the Department of Putumayo between the Ríos Putumayo and Caquetá east at least to the mouth of the Río Cahuinarí, a right bank affluent of the Caquetá. It is not known to occur in the Colombian trapezius (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler 2003, 2004).<br/><br/>In Peru, it is evidently limited largely to the eastern Amazon. Hershkovitz (1977) mapped numerous localities south of the Río Napo, along the lower and middle Río Ucayali and the Río Tapiche. The westernmost locality given by Hershkovitz (1977, map p.864) is on the Rio Marañon, but it is listed in the gazetteer as “Apaga (Rio), enters Río Putumayo from south at approximately 4º42'S, 77º10'W, P. Soini, April 1970, sight record”. The coordinates would seem to be right, but the description of the locality wrong, and the Rio Marañon is excluded from the distribution map of Aquino and Encarnación (1994a). These authors have <em>Callimico </em>only definitely occurring south of the lower Ucayali (from the mouth of the Rio Blanco), extending to both sides of the Ucayali at about 6ºS and south along the Andean foothills to the Río Pachitea and the Madre de Dios.

They use all levels of the forest, but forage and travel mainly in the lower canopy and understorey. Locomotion involves predominantly quadupredal walking and running.<br/><br/>Squirrel monkeys are small frugivore-insectivores. They spend 75-80% of their day foraging for insects and other small animal prey (Mittermeier and Van Roosmalen 198, Terborgh 1983, Boinski 1988). During dry season shortages of appropriate fruiting trees they are able to depend entirely on animal prey (Janson and Boinski 1992). <br/><br/><em>Saimiri</em> groups are multi-male and can be large, up to 100 animals (larger groups are believed to be temporary mergers of two) but most frequently are of 20-75 individuals (Baldwin and Baldwin 1981, Terborgh 1983, Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 1991). As emphasized by Boinski (1999a,b, 2005, Boinski <em>et al.</em> 2005a,b) allthough all squirrel monkeys are morphologicallly very similar, their social systems are quite distinct (summarized in Sussman 2000).<br/><br/>In <em>S. boliviensis</em>, studied by Terborgh (1983) and Mitchell <em>et al.</em> (1991), groups range from 45 to 75 individuals. Females form stable, probably kin-based, coalitions and dominance hierarchy. Females are philopatric (remain in the groups they were born in), while males leave their groups at 4-5 years old, form all-male (bachelor) groups and then disperse into other groups with both sexes. Males are generally unfriendly to each other, and change groups every one or two years. Females commonly show social agression amongst themselves. Adult females are always dominant to males, harass them, and maintain on them on the periphery of the group. Unlike <em>S. oerstedi</em>, males do not show anti-predator vigilance. The fruits they typically exploit occur in large patches of moderate density, and feeding competition is higher than in <em>S. oerstedii</em>, but lower than in <em>S. sciureus</em>.<br/><br/>In <em>S. sciureus</em>, studied in Suriname by Boinski (1999a,b, 2005, Boinski <em>et al.</em> 2005a,b), group sizes range from 15 to 50, and both sexes form a single, linear hiearchy in the group, with most males being dominant to females. Aggression between females is uncommon, but they  do not form coalitions. Males form coalitions and can aggressive to each other. Males show vigilance in defense agianst predators. The fruits they exploit typically occur in small but extremely dense patches, and there is considerable feeding competition between group members, much higher than in <em>S. boliviensis</em>. <br/><br/>In <em>S. oerstedii</em>, females do not form dominance hierarchies, and there is no evidence of coalition formation in social interactions. Females transfer between groups before first mating season, and males are philopatric. There is little competition or agonistic interactions between groups, and males show high levels of vigilance for predators.  Reproductively mature males collaborate in mobbing females during the mating season. Their fruits they typically exploit occur in small and very scarce patches, and feeding competition is very low. <br/><br/>Mating and births in <em>Saimiri</em> are highly seasonal, seldom exceeding two months in duration. Single offspring. Mating usually occurs during the dry season. In <em>S. oerstedii</em> sexual receptivity in females is synchronized, and lasts only one or two days each season. In <em>S. sciureus</em>, birth synchrony is less pronounced, and the female gives birth occur once a year (Rowe 1996). In <em>S. boliviensis</em>, the interbirth interval is 24 months (Mitchell 1994).<br/><br/><em>Saimiri boliviensis</em> and <em>S. sciureus</em> frequently form interspecific associations, travelling with <em>Cebus albifrons</em> or <em>Cebus apella</em> (Terborgh 1983, Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2000), benefitting from the disturbance caused by the capuchin monkeys above them, which flushes out insects and small animal prey.<br/><br/>Size: <br/>Weight: Adult male 992 g, adult female more than 751 g.","This species is hunted for subsistence use particularly in areas that have already suffered the loss of larger primate species. Habitat loss is also occurring, although not levels that warrant threatened status. Some capture for pets and medical research occurs, notably in Peru.","The species is common, occurring frequently in large groups of more than 50 animals.

Abundance characteristics are not appreciably different between the two subspecies.<br/><br/>Bolivia<br/>Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2000) recorded primate encounter rates along transects at eight sites in the Rios Blanco y Negro Wildlife Reserve, Santa Cruz, Bolivia. <em>Saimiri boliviensis</em> was seen at two of the sites with an encounter rate of 0.2 and 0.7 groups/10 km, or 4.9 and  9.8 individuals/10 km, respectively. In the Beni Reserve, Painter <em>et al.</em> (1995) recorded an encounter rate of 0.6 groups or 20 individuals/10 km. In the Bosque Chimanes, Rumiz and Herrera (1994) recorded 1.7 groups or 36.4 individuals/10 km. Wallace <em>et al.</em> (1998) did not find squirrel monkeys in the Noel Kempf Mercado National Park where they surveyed (east of the Río San Martín, Santa Cruz Department).<br/><br/>Brazil<br/>Peres (1997) estimated densities of <em>S. boliviensis boliviensis</em> at várzea (white-water flooded forest) in the Brazilian Amazon: Sacado do Condor 70.7 individuals/km²; Boa Esperança 149.2 individuals/km².

It is estimated that the number of mature individuals is higher than 10,000. The principal threats are related to agriculture, cattle ranching, rural development, urban expansion, deforestation, reduction and fragmentation of habitat, and increase of freeways and energy matrices, including flooding from hydroelectric projects, all especially in the last 30 years. It is believed that these factors are causing a population reduction of about 30% in three generations (24 years). For this reason, the species is categorized as Near Threatened (NT). It almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A4c.","<em>Saimiri ustus</em> prefers seasonally flooded habitats (várzea and igapó), and gallery forests, but also occurs in terra firme forests and transitional forests on the Amazon-Cerrado border (Baldwin and Baldwin 1981, Oliveira and Boubli 2008, Alves 2013, Rylands and Mittermeier 2013). The taxon is not restricted to primary habitats, and shows tolerance to habitat modification, so is found in disturbed habitats such as forest fragments, forest borders, and secondary forests (e.g. Vulinec <em>et al. </em>2006, Ferrari <em>et al</em>. 1998), probably because of the high availability of arthropods in those habitats. In REBIO Guaporé, Rondônia, Alves (2013) found <em>S. ustus</em> in all the types of forest that were studied (terra firme, igapó, gallery and cerradão), as did Haugaasen &amp; Peres (2005) in Lago Uauaçu, Amazonas (terra firme, várzea and igapó). However, in RDS Estadual Piagaçu-Purus, Amazonas, Kasecker (2006) found <em>S. ustus</em> only in seasonally flooded forests (várzea and igapó), not in terra firme forests. The diet of <em>Saimiri ustus</em>, much like the other species of squirrel monkeys, is frugivore-insectivore, made up principally of mature fruit, orthopterans and lepidopterans, and other small arthropods and arachnids (Baldwin and Baldwin 1981, Rylands 1987, Rylands and Mittermeier 2013). They occasionally eat flowers, nectar, seeds, bird eggs, and small vertebrates like frogs or lizards (Baldwin and Baldwin 1981, Rylands and Mittermeier 2013). <em>Saimiri ustus </em>group have large home ranges of 130 ha up to more than 250 ha (Baldwin and Baldwin 1981, Rylands 1987), and can overlap extensively with other groups (Eisenberg and Redford 1999). The species is often found in association with other primates, especially&#160; <em>Sapajus apella</em>; this may give foraging and antipredator advantages (Baldwin and Baldwin 1981, Terborgh 1983, Rylands 1987). On the Purus River, Amazonas, <em>Saimiri ustus </em>was observed in association with <em>Sapajus</em>, <em>Cebus</em>, <em>Pithecia </em>and <em>Alouatta</em>, but most often with <em>Sapajus apella </em>in várzea habitat (Haugaasen and Peres 2009). In FLONA Tapajós, Pará (Andrade 2007) and REBIO Guaporé, Rondônia (Alves <em>et al</em>. 2012), mixed groups of <em>Saimiri ustus</em> and <em>Sapajus apella </em>were the most frequently observed primate association.&#160; In general, <em>Saimiri </em>typically prefers seasonally inundated forests, river edge forest, floodplain, and secondary forests.

Haugaasen and Peres (2005) observed groups (thought to be <em>S. ustus</em>) with an average size of 12.4 and 22.7 individuals, depending on the ecology (terra firme, várzea, igapó), in Lake Uauaçu, on the left bank of the lower Purus River.&#160; In Guaporé (REBIO Guaporé), Rondônia, Alves (2013) registered groups sizes from 10.9 to 16.4 individuals, depending on the habitat (terra firme, igapó, cerradao). As emphasized by Boinski (1999a,b, 2005, Boinski<em> et al</em>. 2005a,b) although all squirrel monkeys are morphologically very similar, their social systems are quite distinct (summarized in Sussman 2000). There have been no long-term behavioral studies of this species, however, so some aspects of its behavioural ecology are inferred from those of other species.<br/><br/>Mating and births in <em>Saimiri </em>are highly seasonal, with seasons seldom exceeding two months in duration. A single offspring is born. Mating usually occurs during the dry season. In<em> S. oerstedii</em>, sexual receptivity in females is synchronized, and lasts only one or two days each season. In <em>S. sciureus</em>, birth synchrony is less pronounced and births occur only once every two years.&#160;<br/>Size:&#160;Adult male 620-1,200 g (mean 910 g); adult female 710-880 g (mean 795 g) (Jack 2007).","Although the species is wide ranging, much of its range in northern Mato Grosso and southern Pará is undergoing massive deforestation along the so-called arc of deforestation (the advancing agricultural frontier of logging, cattle, and soy beans).<br/><br/>In the Rio Madeira region, there are several hydroelectric projects (Santo Antônio and Jirau) that have or will inundate flooded forests, this species' preferred habitat. Also, in the past 15 years there has been intensive habitat loss in the southern third of this species range due to agriculture and logging activities.","The total population size is unknown, but the number of mature individuals must be over 10,000.<br/><br/><strong>Population abundance: </strong><br/>REBIO Guaporé/RO: 37.6 ind./km² (open igapó), 36.1 ind./km² (terra firme), 27.0 ind./km² (dense igapó), 18.2 ind./km² (cerradão) (Alves 2013); PARNA Serra da Cutia, REBIO Estadual Traçadal, REBIO Estadual Rio Ouro Preto and Parque Estadual Guajará-Mirim/RO: sightings varied between 0.05 and 0.30 sighted/10 km (Messias 2003); FLONA do Jamari/RO: sightings varied from 0.07 sighted/10 km (control area) to 0.43 sighted./10 km (area impacted by mineral exploitation and in intermediate vegetational regrowth), with an average of 0.24 sightings/10 km for four study areas of 1,197.3 km² (M.

It has a more restricted range than was supposed by Hershkovitz (1984), who placed it east of the Rio Purus south as far as the region of the rios Sepatini and Guaporé, east to the Rios Xingu or Iriri. J. S. Silva Jr. (pers. comm.) believes it extends east of the Rio Purus to the Rios Tapajós and Juruena, with its range including a belt along the southern margin of the Rio Solimões along the lower reaches of the southern tributaries, including the Rios Coarí and Tefé to the east (left bank) of the Rio Juruá. It extends south to the upper reaches of the Rio Guaporé and the headwaters of the Juruena. It is replaced by <em>Saimiri sciureus sciureus</em> just south of the Rio Amazonas, east of the Tapajós, on the Ilha Tupinambarama, east to Parintins.&#160; Some evidence suggests that there are two species that are morphologically distinct, but currently lumped together as <em>S. ustus</em> (Thorington 1985, Lynch Alfaro <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).There are some indications that the current distribution of <em>S. ustus</em> in Brazil is reduced in relation to the historic area of occupation (Oliveira and Boubli 2008). According to Oliveira and Boubli (2008), the population decline and extirpation from the previous range is happening especially due to the rapid loss of habitats in the Southern portion of its distribution, which coincides with the ‘arc of deforestation’ (Rondônia, Mato Grosso and the South of Pará states).<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) for the species is estimated at about 922,000 km² and the area of occupancy (AOO) is more than 2.000 km².",,Terrestrial,"<strong>EXISTING CONSERVATION ACTIONS:</strong><br/>There are no specific existing actions for <em>Saimiri ustus</em>.

At Ennedi Massif, northeastern Chad, and Äir Massif, central northern Niger, <em>E. patas</em> occurs in subdesertic grass, sparse <em>Acacia</em> woodland, and bushland (Dekeyser 1950, S. Turner pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>Although <em>E. patas</em> can climb trees when alarmed, it usually relies on its speed on the ground to escape.<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. pyrrhonotus </em>is omnivorous, feeding on gums, arthropods, berries, flowers, fruits, and seeds (Chism and Rowell 1988, De Jong <em>et al.</em> 2008, Isbell 2013). Visits to water are typically daily during the dry season. Often use man-made water sources (e.g., dams, tanks, troughts). Use fences to sit on and scan from. In all areas were encountered in Kenya, <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> are somewhat habituated to humans, mainly to pastoralists, farmers and 'monkey chasers' in crop fields. In Busia District, central western Kenya, they have adapted to a high human population and little natural vegetation. Here, they eat maize and other crops (De Jong <em>et al.</em> 2008, Butynski and De Jong 2014b). In Kidepo Valley National Park, northeastern Uganda, <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus </em>raid garbage bins on a daily basis (Butynski and De Jong 2014a).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. pyrrhonotus</em> lives in single-male groups of 13-56 individuals (Chism and Rowell 1988). Burnham (2004) reported longer day ranges for all-male groups (mean 7.3 km/day) compared with social groups (mean 4.7 km/day) in the same area of Laikipia County, central Kenya. Here, home range sizes of social groups are 23-40 km², depending on group size (Chism and Rowell 1988, Enstam and Isbell 2004), but elsewhere can be as large as 52 km² (e.g., group of 31 individuals in Murchison Falls National Park, northwestern Uganda; Hall 1965).</p>","<p>                   </p><p>Main threats to <em>Erythrocebus patas</em> throughout the geographic distribution, but probably particularly in East Africa, are habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due primarily to agricultural expansion and intensification (both crops and livestock), charcoal production and ’development’ activities (e.g., settlements, roads, powerlines, dams, wind farms).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is primarily distributed throughout the Sahelian Region and Sudanian Region. The Sahel is a region with major land degradation related to its rapidly growing human population (UNEP 2012). The Sahelian Region holds about 8 people/km², while the Sudanian Region has about 31 people/km² (Eva <em>et al</em>. 2006). Between now and 2050, almost 24% of the global human population increase will occur in 10 of the 11 countries of the Sahelian Region (UNDP 2017). The rapid growing human population has converted large parts of the originally wooded savanna to agriculture, grassland and bushland (UNEP 2012). The woodlands of the Sudanian Region are under similar pressure. During 1990-2000 alone, a massive 25,000 km²/yr of dry forest and woodlands were lost in the Sudanian Region (FAO 2005). This rapid and extensive loss of <em>E. patas</em> habitat over the Sahelian Region and Sudanian Region is expected to continue over the long term.<br/><br/>In Africa, the ‘Rate of Natural Increase’ of the human population is 2.5%, compared to 1.1% worldwide (PRB 2019). Over all of the range states for <em>E. patas</em>, the human population is doubling every 20-30 years. As such, there is ever increasing competition between people and <em>E. patas</em> for habitat and water (De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2009; Isbell 2013, Butynski and De Jong 2014b). In none of the range states are natural resources, such as water, soil, bushlands or woodlands, being used sustainably. Perennial water sources have been lost and competition with people and livestock over access to water is severe (De Jong and Butynski 2017). Among the results are widespread degradation, loss and fragmentation of <em>E. patas</em> habitat, and a rapid decline in the abundance and geographic distribution of this species. <br/><br/>The species is in rapid decline in Laikipia County, central Kenya (De Jong and Butynski 2017).<em> E. p. pyrrhonotus </em>is the most threatened primate, despite the fact that this monkey is relatively compatible with livestock ranching, the primary economic activity in Laikipia (Butynski and De Jong 2014b). Habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation are predominantly caused by over-grazing and over-browsing by livestock, conversion of large areas to cropland, uncontrolled cutting of trees, charcoal production, and colonization of invasive plants, particularly Prickly Pears <em>Opuntia</em> spp. Damage is most severe in and around rural and communal areas – where the human population is most dense and where the extraction of natural resources is most intense and unsustainable (De Jong and Butynski 2017). High densities of Savanna Elephant <em>Loxodonta</em> <em>africana</em> over large parts of Laikipia County, and concentrations of Black Rhinoceros <em>Diceros</em> <em>bicornis</em> and Reticulated Giraffe <em>Giraffa reticulata</em> in some areas, have greatly reduced the abundance of Whistling Thorn Acacia, a key food species for Patas in Laikipia County (Isbell 1998, De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008, De Jong and Butynski 2017).<br/><br/>In West Africa, much <em>E. p. patas</em> habitat has been degraded and lost due to fire, desertification, and livestock grazing and browsing (Oates 2011).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. patas</em> is hunted for food in Central Africa and West Africa (Kurpiers <em>et al</em>. 2016), and is widely persecuted as a crop pest (De Jong 2004, De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. villiersi</em> reported to raid crops (Dekeyser 1950) and is, most likely, persecuted in response.</p><p></p>","<p><em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is a widespread species which typically occurs at low densities. Probably more abundant in the western parts of the range (although there are no recent surveys to confirm this) than in the east (Isbell 2013). Typical density might be 1.5 animals/km². Hall (1965) recorded 110 Patas in a 3,112 km² area in northern Uganda. In Kidepo Valley National Park, northeastern Uganda, the rate of encounter with <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> from a slow-moving vehicle was 0.05 groups/hr. (0.002 groups/km; Butynski and De Jong 2017).<br/><br/>In Kenya, the geographic distribution of <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> declined about 56% from <em>ca</em> 93,120 km² prior to 1995 to <em>ca</em> 52,520 km² in 2014, and the size of gaps among populations increased (De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008, Butynski and De Jong 2014a).<br/><br/>During 1979–1981, Laikipia Country supported a minimum of 415 <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> (14–15 groups; Isbell and Chism 2007). The number in 2000 was 310–445 individuals (13–17 groups; Isbell and Chism 2007). In 2017, there were about 145-155 individuals (13 groups) in eastern Laikipia (De Jong and Butynski 2017). Although the 2017 survey did not include western Laikipia, the survey area was more than twice the size of that of the two previous surveys. Mean group size of <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> in eastern Laikipia in 2017 was 12 individuals. Patas numbers have declined in eastern Laikipia mainly through reduction in group size rather than through a reduction in the number of groups (De Jong and Butynski 2017). Although surveys in western Laikipia are required, the preliminary data suggest that there are far fewer Patas in western Laikipia than in eastern Laikipia (Y. de Jong and T. Butynski pers. obs). It is likely that Laikipia County supported &lt;225 Patas in 2017.<br/><br/>This subspecies<em> </em>appears to no longer be present at Alupe, Busia District, western Kenya. There is a population of unknown size and geographic distribution in the Karasuk Hills region of central western Kenya (De Jong and Butynski 2013, 2014, Butynski and De Jong 2014a).<br/><br/>In 2016, in an area of <em>ca</em> 200 km² on the Ennedi Massif, northeastern Chad, S. Turner (pers. comm. 2016) encountered five or six groups of <em>E. patas</em> (total 80-100 individuals) during a brief visit.<br/><br/>In Bafing Faunal Reserve, southern Mali, <em>E. p. patas</em> occurred at 1.7 individuals/km² in 1993 (Pavy 1993 in Oates 2011).<br/><br/>In Comoé National Park, northern Côte d’Ivoire, <em>ca</em> 1,150 <em>E. p. patas</em> occupied <em>ca</em> 11,500 km² in 1991 (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2000 in Oates 2011). <br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. patas</em> is common in the Gadabedji Biosphere Reserve, central Niger (T. Rabeil pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Magin (1990) estimated a population of 500 <em>E. p. villiersi </em>in the central massifs and plateau of the Aïr Massif, central northern Niger (IUCN 2017).<br/><br/><em>Erythrocebus p. villiersi </em>is common on Aïr Massif (T. Rabeil, T. Wacher and J. Darbey pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Between now and 2050, almost 24% of the global demographic increase will  occur in 10 of the 11 countries of the Sahelian Region (UNDP 2017). Across the species' global range, the rapidly growing human population has converted large parts of the originally wooded savanna to agriculture, grassland, and bushland (UNEP 2012). The woodlands of the Sudanian Region are under similar pressure. During 1990 to 2000 alone, a massive 25,000 km²/yr of dry forest and woodlands were lost in the Sudanian Region (FAO 2005). Based on these levels of habitat loss, the global population of <em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is suspected to have declined by at least 20% over the last 30 years (three generations).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Erythrocebus patas</em> is endemic to tropical Africa. This species ranges in the Sahelian Region and Sudanian Region north of the equatorial forests and south of the Sahara, from western Senegal and The Gambia, southern Mauritania, Guinea Bissau, and northern Guinea eastwards to northern Uganda, South Sudan, and southwestern Ethiopia, and southwards to the Laikipia Plateau in central Kenya (De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2009, Oates 2011, Isbell 2013, De Jong and Butynski 2017). Altitudinal range is from sea level to 2,050 m asl (A. Galat-Luong and G.

Used as a research animal. There is a need to clarify how many research animals are captive bred and how many are wild caught.

The Red-shanked Douc is diurnal and arboreal but occasionally come to the ground as evinced by a number of camera-trap pictures within its range.<br/><br/>The species has been very little studied in the wild with only two long-term (&gt;12 months) studies, and other opportunistic observations (Lippold 1998; Phiapalath 2009; Ulibarri 2013). The diet of Red-shanked Douc consists mainly of leaves (consistently with a highest percentage of young leaves), followed by fruits/seeds, flowers, bark/pith (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003; Phiapalath 2009; Ulibarri 2013). The group dynamics of the species remain little understood. Studies suggest the species has a modular society characterized by fission-fusion of several one-male units gathering and dividing daily (Ulibarri 2013; Long Thang Ha pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Because of this apparent group dynamics observed in the species and genus, home range is challenging to assess and needs to be distinguished between home range of the unit vs. home range of the group (i.e., fusion of &gt;1 units). In Lao PDR, the average home range for two groups (of 19 and 39 individuals, both comprising between 2 to 3 units) was estimated at 3 km²<sup> </sup>(Phiapalath 2009). In Viet Nam, home range of a group (21 individuals, including three units) was estimated at 36 ha (Ulibarri 2013). The striking contrast between these two estimates calls for additional long-term studies on the species. In Viet Nam, it was found that the fission–fusion pattern is strongly related to the daily activity budgets, food availability and rainfall (Ulibarri 2013). Average size of a unit was 6.5 individuals, average size of a group was 18 individuals, and groups averaged ~3 units/group. Units were one-male/multi-female and multi-male/multi-female (Ulibarri 2013).<br/><br/>The annual activity budget of <em>P. nemaeus</em> was estimated in limestone forest in Lao PDR at 40% feeding, 10% moving, 33% resting, 5% socialising and 14% other activities (Phiapalath 2009). In Viet Nam, in a coastal evergreen forest, the species spent 35% ‘inactive’, 29% moving, 22% socialising, 14% feeding and 1% self-grooming (Ulibarri 2013).<br/><br/>Additional research needs to be done on the ecology of the species to clarify its home range, group dynamics, diet and nutritional requirements.</p>","<p>Hunting has been and still is the major threat to <em>Pygathrix nemaeus</em> across its range. Habitat loss has also been a major threat in Viet Nam with extensive logging for coffee, rubber, and cashew plantations (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2004), and in Lao PDR where logging is underway at an increasing rate for mining, agriculture, forestry and hydropower projects, mostly by large Chinese and Vietnamese companies (Smirnov 2015). Habitat loss and fragmentation have led to an increase in access to remote forests for illegal hunting of the species, contributing to the alarming declines of the global population. Hunting of the species across its range is for local consumption (the meat of doucs is highly favoured by locals) or for national and/or international trade. Pet trade in Red-shanked Douc may also drive hunting (Tran Thu Hang 2010), though to a lesser extent and is likely to be more opportunistic than directed, occurring when adults are killed leaving behind orphans, which are sold as pets. In Lao PDR, the species is hunted by both Lao and Vietnamese poachers crossing the border. Lao hunters often sell poached doucs to Vietnamese. Doucs are highly valued in Viet Nam for the traditional medicine; bones are processed to make a paste, which is used for the ‘treatment’ of various ailments. Due to hunting, Red-shanked Douc has already been largely extirpated throughout Viet Nam with the exceptions of populations in Phong Nha Ke Bang NP, where the species is apparently naturally protected by the difficult accessibility of this karst-based forest habitat, at least in its most remote sites, and in Son Tra NP where, although suitable forest for the species is now very limited, hunting seems under control and the species attracts a significant number of national and international tourists (Ha Thang Long pers. comm. 2015). In Virachey NP, illegal poaching occurs and doucs are hunted, most likely by Vietnamese poachers (G. McCann pers. comm. 2016). As douc populations are decreasing at an alarming rate, the hunting pressure on the species is expected to rise rapidly in all remaining areas where it occurs.<br/><br/>By the mid-to-late 1990s, Red-shanked Douc populations in several areas in Lao PDR and Viet Nam had already been greatly reduced or totally extirpated despite remaining suitable habitat (Timmins and Duckworth 1999; Nadler <em>et al. </em>2003). This decline has been continuous and is likely to be increasing with the demand and lucrative trade in wildlife including specifically Doucs. Populations in Viet Nam alone have decreased to just a few individuals left in most localities of occurrence (Nadler 2010). In Lao PDR, several sites that were visited in the mid-1990s and then again in the 2000s and 2010s suggest a surprising decline in Red-shanked Doucs (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013) The still large and healthy population of Red-shanked Doucs are now confined to the largest forest blocks in the range countries (Phiaphalath 2009, Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in the past 36 years (and much less) habitat loss in range countries has been on the rise due to large development projects (e.g., dams, roads, mining, agriculture plantations) (Smirnov 2015); therefore those contiguous forest blocks—even protected areas—are much more extensively accessed today than in the recent past, which predicts a continuing decline in Red-shanked Doucs due to harvesting, principally in those areas with a lack of or poor conservation management; one or other of these situations applies to all protected areas holding the species.</p>","<p>The world’s largest remaining population of Red-shanked Douc Langur is in Lao PDR, particularly in the near-contiguous Nakai-Nam Theun and Hin Namno National Protected Areas (NPA), which are likely to represent the largest contiguous suitable habitat for the species (Coudrat <em>et al. </em>2012, 2013). Nakai-Nam Theun NPA probably holds the world’s largest population with an estimate of at least 4,500 groups in the area’s suitable habitat, estimated to comprise at least 1,600 km². Red-shanked Doucs are fairly frequently encountered in this area, although nowadays at lower rates than langurs <em>Trachypithecus</em> in Hin Namno NPA (Phiapalath 2009, Coudrat 2015); in the late 1990s rates were comparable between the genera (Timmins and Duckworth 1999). Xe Sap NPA also appears to retain a significant population (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013). The most remote suitable forested areas in Lao PDR within the species’ range evidently still hold large numbers, but population estimates are not available for most areas. Despite the remaining large population in Lao PDR, the population in the past three decades has dramatically declined.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the population has declined extremely steeply due to intensive and continuous hunting and habitat loss; these threats are still ongoing and at an increasing rate. Many areas where doucs were recorded during the 1990s to 2002 lack evidence of their subsequent persistence (Nadler 2010). Wildlife surveys found &lt;30 individuals in Bach Ma NP (Le Thi Dien <em>et al.</em> 2010), about 30-70 individuals in Dak Rong NR (Nguyen Dac Manh <em>et al.</em> 2009, Dang Huy Huynh and Nguyen Manh Ha 2005) and a few groups (not comprehensive survey of the area) in Bac Huong Hoa NR (Mahood and Tran Van Hung 2008). The largest population in Viet Nam is believed to be in Phong Nha Ke Bang with up to 2,000 individuals (Haus <em>et al.</em> 2009), though this may be an over estimate (Nadler 2010). Son Tra NP, located near Da Nang, the fifth largest city of Viet Nam, is thought to hold the second largest population in Viet Nam. This is estimated at only about 200 individuals (Vu Ngoc Thanh<em> et al.</em> 2007; Lippold and Vu Ngoc Thanh 2008; Dinh Thi Phuong Anh <em>et al.</em> 2010). At this site, suitable habitat is no more than 50 km², amid a zone of large-scale infrastructure development, and hunting occurs occasionally in the area. Chu Mom Ray NP may still hold a small population, representing a possible zone of sympatry and/or hybridization, but the taxonomic status of the species there is uncertain (Lippold <em>et al.</em> 2011). Outside protected areas in Viet Nam, some small populations were recorded in the buffer zone of Phong Dien NR and Bach Ma NP (Van Ngoc Thinh <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, animals genetically identifiable as Red-shanked Douc, but not morphologically typical, occur in Virachay National Park and a forest area in Voensai District. In both these areas the population is considered large based on frequent encounters (Rawson 2010). Grey-shanked Douc may also range in at least part of these areas, and hybridization has been recorded (Rawson and Roos 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in eastern Lao PDR, central Viet Nam and, perhaps northeastern Cambodia. In Viet Nam Red-shanked Douc ranges from Pu Mat National Park (NP) (19°02’N) in the north to Chu Mom Ray NP (14°22’N) in the south (Ha Thang Long 2007, 2009). In Lao PDR, the species has been confirmed from Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area (formerly known as Nam Theun Extension; 18°38’N), down to the Cambodian border (14°25’N) (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Cambodia, a few individuals were first observed in 2007 (at N14°01’52.2”, E106°44’05.6”) and again in 2008 (at N14°01’32.4”, E106°42’51.9”) in Voensei District, Ratanakiri Province. The individuals observed showed some facial characteristics of Red-shanked Douc, but were otherwise not typical of Red-shanked Douc morphologically (e.g., lacking red on the legs, lacking white on the forearms, mostly uniformly grey body but with some variations observed between individuals); some DNA (mitochondrial, autosomal and sex chromosome fragments) was extracted from faecal samples collected following the 2007-sighting, which indicated closest similarity to Red-shanked Douc (Rawson and Roos 2008). There has not been new genetic analysis on a larger sample since. Across its range, the species’ typical pelage characteristics are somewhat lost gradually from north to south: in southern Lao PDR, some individuals have also been observed with reduced red on the legs and white on the forearms (Timmins and Duckworth 1999). Additional genetic analysis on these animals will be required to clarify morphological characteristics of Red-shanked Douc and the distribution range of the species. Grey-shanked Douc might occur sympatrically with<em> </em>Red-shanked Douc in the southernmost part of the range of Red-shanked Douc<em>. </em>Previous suggestion that<em> </em>Black-shanked Douc occurs in the same site as Red-shanked Douc in northeastern Cambodia was in error (Rawson 2010; B. Rawson pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>The species has been recorded from around sea level to 1,700 m asl (Lippold 1998; Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012; Ulibarri 2013). Given patterns of survey, it is possible that it occurs, or occurred in the recent past, to altitudes considerably above 1,700 m.<em></em></p>",This species is hunted for meat and 'medicine'.

This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or slightly higher in the next 36 years.","<p><span class=""None"">These animals are predominantly arboreal but occasionally come to the ground. They are found in evergreen, semi-evergreen and semi-evergreen-mixed deciduous forest mosaics, as well as in coastal dry forest. It seems that this species can adapt to relatively heavily disturbed forest (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species occurs from sea level in Nui Chua NP to over 2,000 m asl. in Bidoup Nui Ba NP (Hoang Minh Duc 2007; Hoang Minh Duc pers. comm). Diet is apparently variable by site, being mainly composed of leaves with differing levels of supplementation with seeds, fruits and flowers (Hoang Minh Duc <em>et al</em>. 2009; Rawson 2009). The species consumes plant parts of more than 150 plant species but are quite selective. Factors determining food selection are poorly known. The species was reported to choose plant species with high in protein and low in tannin compared to non-selected species (O’Brien 2014) but another study did not confirm this conclusion (Hoang Minh Duc <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species shows seasonal shifting in habitat preferences in order to track leaf resources (O’Brien 2014).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>The annual activity budget of <em>P. nigripes</em> was estimated in evergreen forest in Cambodia at 61% inactivity, 27% feeding, 6% travel, 3% social behaviour, and 2% other activities (Rawson 2009) while in a coastal dry forest in Ninh Thuan Province of Viet Nam, the species spent 42.9% inactive, 35.0% feeding, 14.7% moving, 6.0% socializing, and 1.40% other behaviours (Hoang Minh Duc 2007). The species is reported to exhibit a fission-fusion social organization with smaller groups of one-male units banding together to form much larger groups (Hoang Minh Duc 2007, O’Brien 2014, Rawson 2009) and bachelor groups and lone males were also observed (Hoang Minh Duc 2007; Rawson 2009). Because of the complex social organization additional study is needed to understand ranging behavior. Home range of a group of <em>P. nigripes</em> in evergreen forest in Cambodia was estimated at 20.4 ha and daily path length ranged between 514 m and 943 m (Rawson 2009) while home range of a OMU with five individuals recorded in semi-evergreen forest in Binh Thuan Province was estimated at 12.4 ha and its daily path length was 354±250 m (Nguyen Thanh Trung and Hoang Minh Duc 2015).</span></p>","<p><span class=""None"">The key threats to the taxon include hunting for traditional medicine and local consumption and loss and fragmentation of forest habitats due to legal and illegal logging, conversion for agriculture, and construction of roads and hydroelectric dams.<br/><br/>Hunting is currently the major threat to this species (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). It is most often hunted for traditional “medicine”, mainly from people coming from the north of Viet Nam where hunting of Doucs for this purpose is more common; in the southern part of Viet Nam, hunting is primarily for the pet trade. Between 2008 and 2010 there were a confirmed total of over 150 Black-shanked Doucs being poached in Viet Nam (Hoang Minh Duc pers. comm).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>Destruction of its natural habitat is also a threat to this species; a large portion in the centre and south of Viet Nam suffered from massive wartime damage, and the post-war human demographic explosion and extensive logging for coffee, rubber, and cashew plantations have reduced its natural habitat. Most forest at lowland elevations has been cleared and little forest remains undisturbed (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). The resettlement of some 3 million people from the north of Viet Nam to the central highlands is likely to exacerbate rates of habitat loss through the Vietnamese range of the species. Development including new road construction in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia has been associated with a rapid increase of illegal logging that is negatively impacting habitat for the Black-shanked Doucs.</span></p>","<span class=""None"">The largest known population exists in Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area, Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia, where distance estimates provide a population estimate of approximately 42,000 individuals (95% confidence interval of 27,309–66,460) (Pollard <em>et al</em>. 2007). The densities found in Seima are probably close to carrying capacity for the species in such habitat (Rawson 2009).

(Ha Thang Long 2004, 2007, 2009). Like the other doucs, <em>Pygathrix cinerea</em> is largely arboreal and mainly folivorous, though plant buds, fruit, seeds, and flowers are also taken (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003; Ha Thang Long 2009). The most detailed study of the ecology of this species is Ha Thang Long (2009) and he found that their annual diet consisted of 49.5% young leaves, 9.3% mature leaves, fruits and seeds 40%. He also noted that there were significant differences in the diet between the wet and dry seasons with fruit being consumed at a much higher frequency in the wet season and the young leaves in the dry season. Ha Thang Long <em>et al.</em> (2010) reported on differences in activity budgets in the wet and dry season also. They found that this species’ activity budget in the wet season was 41% resting, 22% moving, 11% feeding, and 26% socializing.&#160; In contrast the activity budget during the dry season was 32% resting, 31% moving, 13% feeding, and 24% socializing. This species is usually observed in one male – multi-female groups. A number of these groups occasionally will come together to form a large band. All male groups also occur (Ha Thang Long 2009).","<span class=""None"">The Central Highlands forests in Viet Nam where these animals occur lose almost 10,000 ha of forest annually due to logging, agricultural conversion, building hydropower stations, and construction of roads. This creates a progressively more fragmented habitat and population structure. Additionally, they are hunted for food, traditional ""medicine"" (for example it is used in the preparation of ""monkey balm""), and for sale as pets (Ha Thang Long 2004, 2007). Their behavioural responses to hunting, hiding motionless in the canopy rather than fleeing, make them more vulnerable (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003); they also become susceptible to snaring when they come to the ground to move in degraded habitats.","The total population for this species is estimated at 550 to 700 individuals, but some areas with assumed occurrence are not yet surveyed (Ha Thang Long 2004).<br/><br/>                    <span class=""None"">The global population is unknown but is likely smaller than 2,000.

However, in the absence of more detailed data regarding current geographic range and demographic trends, the species remains listed as Least Concern.</p>  <a name=""_GoBack""></a>","Geladas are associated with Afroalpine grasslands and adjacent rocky gorges and precipices (Bergman and Beehner 2013). This species feeds mainly on the flat margins of high grass plateaus, known locally as high Wurch or Puna grassland steppe, with <em>Agrostis</em> and <em>Festuca</em> grasses and giant <em>Lobelia</em> groves. Gelada bands consist of 30–289 animals, subdivided into 5–26 one-male units (Bergman and Beehner 2013, Abu <em>et al. </em>2018). Bands keep within 2 km of the escarpment edges, where they retreat at night to sleep or if alarmed (Fashing &amp; Nguyen 2016). Typical annual home-range size for Geladas is 9–12&#160;km²&#160;(Hunter 2001, Moua 2015). Geladas are poor tree-climbers and are almost entirely terrestrial, partly a consequence of their unusual dietary specialization as a grazer (Dunbar 1983).<br/><br/>Geladas feed primarily on the leaves of graminoids (grasses and sedges) and also forbs (Fashing <em>et al. </em>2014, Abu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Jarvey <em>et al.</em> 2018). They also excavate and consume subterranean foods including roots, corms, tubers and rhizomes (Fashing <em>et al</em>. 2014, Abu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Jarvey<em> et al.</em> 2018), especially during the dry season when green vegetation is less abundant (Fashing <em>et al.</em> 2014, Jarvey <em>et al.</em> 2018). Invertebrates are eaten opportunistically (Fashing <em>et al. </em>2010, 2014), and cereal crops may be taken where agriculture encroaches onto the Geladas' habitat (Abu <em>et al. </em>2018, Jarvey <em>et al</em>. 2018).","<p>The overall range of the Gelada is being eroded by agricultural expansion resulting from rapid human population growth in the Ethiopian highlands. Conversion of Gelada habitat to farmland and livestock grazing is common (Bergman and Beehner 2013) and soil erosion is a serious problem throughout the region (Nyssen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Grazing pressure is intense, and competition from domestic livestock has forced the Gelada to remain on the less productive gorge slopes in some areas (e. g. eastern Arsi) (Abu <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gelada densities are considerably lower in heavily populated areas than in undisturbed habitats (R. Burke, pers. obs.).</p>  <p>Geladas are also harassed, shot or hunted with dogs as crop pests (R. Burke, pers. obs.) and occasionally sold locally as pets (Bergman and Beehner 2013). In the past, Geladas were trapped for zoos though this practice no longer occurs. Also, in the past, adult male numbers were reduced as a result of selective shooting for their capes of hair, which were made into ceremonial costumes used by the Oromo people (Dunbar 1977). The extent of this practice today is unknown. There are also historic records of Gelada capes being made into fur hats for tourists (Dunbar 1977).</p>  <p>Government-sanctioned trophy hunting of Geladas by tourists is currently allowed in controlled hunting areas, although the extent and impact of this practice are unknown.</p>  <p>Parasitic swellings caused by tapeworms (<em>Taenia serialis</em>) are a major cause of death in some Gelada populations (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2015, Schneider-Crease <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>Climate change poses a long-term threat to Geladas, especially for populations inhabiting higher elevations, where agriculture has previously been impossible or uncommon (Dunbar 1998).</p>","<p>Geladas are widespread throughout much of their present range, although they are probably not as abundant as they were in the 1970s, when an aerial survey of the central Ethiopian Highlands yielded a population estimate of 440,000 individuals (Dunbar 1977). A concurrent alternative estimate based on known ground densities from a small proportion of the Gelada’s geographic range and the total area of gorge face on the plateau yielded a figure of 884,000 (Dunbar 1977). Detailed ground surveys at five sites yielded overall densities varying between 15 and 69 animals/km², although densities of animals within their home ranges typically reached 70–80/km² (Dunbar 1977).

It is arboreal, mainly terrestrial, diurnal and occurs in multi­male, multi­female groups (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). However, unimale-multifemale groups have also been found. The average group size is 18.3 individuals. Terai Gray Langurs do not form permanent all male groups, but instead stay either single, in pairs or form ephemeral male groups of up to 5 individuals. Population density is generally estimated at 26 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>; in the Kumaon Hills of Himalaya the density was 97 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>This languar is a seasonal breeder, with a birthing season from January to June, peaking in March. Gestation lasts around 209 days and there is an average inter-birth interval of 2.4 years. Infanticide by newcomer males is infrequent but present. Female copulation during pregnancy, to protect paternity of infants and to protect their foetus, has been recorded. Yet, resident males are reported to kill infants despite copulation with mother, especially if the males weren’t around during conception. Male adults that sire offspring are protective of infants.<br/><br/>In Ramnagar, individuals were seen to spend 20% of their time on the ground.&#160;It has been observed feeding in orchards and crop fields outside of Rajaji National Park (A.

A. Kumar (pers. comm.) has observed this species at 3,500 m, but has reports of its occurrence above this elevation, and it may be present up to 4,000 m. It is diurnal, terrestrial, arboreal, and folivorous. It is a diurnal and mainly terrestrial species, but may prefer arboreal canopies to flee from danger. Individuals are sometimes known to prefer barren rock cliffs for warmth.&#160;<br/><br/>Langurs inhabit semi evergreen Sal (<em>Shorea robusta</em>), and alpine cedar forests. They could range as high as as 3,500-4,000 m and could well survive harsh winters and rainy summers in July-October and an annual rainfall as high as 2,500 m. Most of their diet is composed of leaves (40-60%), and the rest of&#160; fruits (20%), ripe, unripe, herbaceous fruits. Other constituents are seeds, storage organs, roots, flowers, cambium, bark, twigs, coniferous cones, moss, lichens, epiphytic fern, young bamboo shoots, rhizome, grass and invertebrate animals. They prefer young leaves of broad-leaved deciduous trees than of evergreen trees. Seasonal variation in food preference is well pronounced. In spring and summer, when their diet is diverse, they feed on leaf clusters of <em>Zanthoxylem nepalense</em>, young leaves and bark of <em>Jasminum humile</em>, acorns, young deciduous leaves, and pine cones. In monsoon, feed on young deciduous leaves and fruits, while in autumn consume unripe fruits, seeds and fleshy ripe fruit, herb leaves and fruit, fleshy plant tissue, cultivated potato <em>Solanum tuberosum</em>. In winter, leaf buds, fruits (ripe) of <em>Cotonester frigidus, Berberis aristata, </em>leaf buds of <em>Sorbus cuspidate</em>, herbs and pinecones.<br/><br/>Birthing is concentrated between late winter to early spring and most mating happens between July-September. This arrangement allows for the langur infants to grow strong to survive their first winter. Besides, winters also mean migration down hill and the independent mobility of infants allows for easy migration for the both the mother and the infant. The inter-birth interval is usually 25 months, until the female gets pregnant and when she weans her infant. Inter-birth intervals are shorter when the infant dies and the female becomes receptive to mate again.<br/><br/>Like other Himalayan species, this species lives in multi-male, multi-female groups. Group sizes range between 4-47 individuals with 1-4 adult males and the female sex ratio 1-1.5-1.7. Larger groups may split while maintaining contact through intermittent call by males. The annual home range is 1,275-12,700 ha due to seasonal migration up and down the mountain. The call of dominant males is a ‘Wao’ or ‘Ua’ and these langurs don’t woop like the southern Indian or plain dwelling langurs. No infanticide during troop takeover was observed, despite 32 months of observation in Junbesi-Ringmo between Kathmandu and Nepal-Sikkim Border.</p>","<p>The taxon, although widely distributed across the Himalayas, is subject to various threats from human interference including logging, habitat loss, fires, human habitations, expansion, developmental activities, encroachment, and war, which makes it susceptible to declines in areas subject to such threats (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).

However, the populations in Jammu-Kashmir fit into the morphological and behavioural patterns of the type locality population, thereby these are now included within the <em>S. ajax</em> assessment.

It is folivorous, diurnal, and mainly terrestrial (Molur&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003). <br/><br/>Multimale-multifemale type social organization. Unimale-multifemale and all male bands have also been observed. Typically, these langurs are found in groups ranging between 25-40 individuals. But occasionally, as in one case in Chamba, they numbered over 100 individuals. In Dachigam, groups of over 500 individuals are seen together in congregation for a brief period during winter, after which they disperse into smaller groups (Mehreen Khaleel pers. comm.).

In Dachigam, they have been found feeding on bark/peel of&#160;<em>Ulmus villosa</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Ulmus wallichiana</em>. They also feed on seeds of&#160;<em>Rhus&#160;</em><em>succedanea</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Pinus wallichiana</em>&#160;in winters. Walnut (<em>Juglans regia</em>) also forms a large part of their diet in the months of August-September. They also known to lick mud and rocks. Cultigens are a substantial part of the diet. They are primarily arboreal but also spend a good part of their time on the ground. Infants with a more dark, brown fur were observed around March/April, so birthing could be around this time. In Dachigam, the greatest number of infants were found during Jan-March. Very little inter-group or intra-group aggression, if any, were observed. During the months of Nov-March when the groups fuse together, behaviour such as aggression (showing of teeth), chasing away the male, and mating take place. The animals, unlike their lowland congeners, do not vocalize the characteristic langur whoop but rather have a deep, grunt like bark. In Chamba they range from about 1,300 m to 3,000 m in sub-alpine cedar and oak forests (Anandam&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>, pers. obs.). In Kashmir, they range from about 1,600-3,000 m and prefer broadleaved deciduous forest habitats, one or two solitary males were found at 3,500 m during summer.</p>","<p>Molur&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2003) list the following past threats: overgrazing, building roads through&#160;forests, logging, deforestation, agriculture, and fire. Present and future threats include&#160;agriculture and development (Molur&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003).<br/><br/>The booming tourism industry around prime habitats like the Khajjiar-Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary is a serious threat. Unregulated tourism has ushered in some unwelcome practices such as non-biodegradable garbage disposal, tourist resorts and food-stalls or&#160;<em>Dhabas,&#160;</em>and loud vehicles through the park. Other such places around the state are now being identified as tourist hotspots therefore the threat is spreading to places new and far. Logging and lopping are other activities in the region but the impact of such activities on the population has not been assessed (Anandam&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Crop foraging is a growing threat across Chamba. In the 2012-2013 survey, 76 of the 244 sites surveyed across the district reported agricultural crop foraging and about 25% of the respondents expressed negative attitude towards langurs (Anandam&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013b). In Kashmir, villages nearby Dachigam, Overa and Hirpora WS reported negative intraction in the form of crop foraging during winter (Dec-Feb) and early spring (March-April). Survey conducted from 2015-2017 in eight districts of Kashmir namely; Pulwama, Srinagar, Anantnag, Shopian, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Budgam and Baramulla reported crop foraging in 7 out of 87 villages. In places close to Dachigam, people retaliate by throwing stones to shoo away the langurs back to protected area.<br/><br/>Due to change in land-use, people have started to grow apple orchards and vegetable farms in villages close to protected areas. This can be considered as a growing cause of crop raiding in places close to Dachigam. For the past three years, villages in Kangan area (District Ganderbal) in Kashmir have reported solitary males foraging on apple and walnut trees. These are usually single males or two. People show neutral attitude towards their presence as no large-scale damage was reported. Only 5% people reported conflict in the entire valley and shoo away monkeys from their fields.<br/></p>","<p>Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2003) estimated a total population of this species as fewer than 500 individuals (250 mature). The valley where it lives is surrounded by snow peaks and therefore it has remained isolated from other langurs, and the population is very small&#160;(M. Singh and C. Groves pers. comm). With the recent information from Dachigam National Park and other places within the Kishtwar Valley of Jammu-Kashmir indicating the population to be&#160;<em>S. ajax</em>, the numbers are estimated to be less than 1,000 mature individuals in the Kishtwar Valley. Dachigam holds the maximum number of mature individuals whereas, at other places the average troop size was found to be around 20-25. The total number of mature individuals is estimated to be less than 1,500 in number. Decline in the past is not known but it is predicted to decline by less than 10% in the next 10 years (Molur&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003).<br/><br/>There are very little data available on the population in Chamba, owing primarily to the steepness of the terrains and shyness of the langurs. But given the many developmental activities in the region, the consequent pressures on the forests, increasing negative interactions with humans, and increasing attacks of the langurs by dogs, one could safely presume that the population is threatened and potentially decreasing (Vishal Ahuja, pers. comm)</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is reported as occurring in northwestern India in Himachal-Pradesh and&#160;Jammu-Kashmir (Groves 2001). It is claimed by Brandon-Jones&#160;(2004) that this species occurs in Melemchi, Nepal. Morphological and behavioural studies indicate its occurrence is restricted only to the Chamba Valley in Himachal-Pradesh and Kishtwar Valley in Jammu-Kashmir. The species range is restricted (&lt;10,000 km²), and therefore also its area of occupancy (&lt;2,000 km²).<br/><br/>Following Pocock's (1928) description, the species is identified only from Chamba (Groves and Molur 2008). All the other populations are considered under the plausibility of variation and hybridization and therefore cautiously await taxonomic scrutiny and verification. Groves (2001) suggests a wide distribution range for the species, from Dehra Dun in the Doon Valley of Shiwaliks to Pakistani Kashmir. But Groves and Molur (2008) restrict the species to Chamba. The report of the species in Machiara National Park in Pakistan by Minhas <em>et al</em>. (2011, 2013) requires verification for species identity. Recent reports of the species from&#160;Dachigam National Park in Jammu-Kashmir&#160;in India (Mir&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2015, Mehreen Khaleel pers. comm., Junaid Shah pers. comm., P.O. Nameer pers. comm.), confirm the identity of the populations to match morphologically with the Chamba Sacred Langurs. The Dachigam population also lack whooping calls, exhibit grunts and teeth grinding like that of the Chamba Sacred Langurs (Mehreen Khaleel, pers. comm.). Therefore, the distribution here is restricted to Chamba and Kishtwar Valleys in western Himalaya. Based on photographs and direct sightings, the langurs from these places in the Kashmir Valley match morphologically with <em>S. ajax</em>: Wangat-Naranag CR, Kazinag NP, Rajparian NP, Overa WS, and Tral CR, all within Jammu-Kashmir.&#160;</p>",The species is not used for any purpose.,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I, and Schedule II Part I, of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 amended up to 2002 (Molur <em>et al., </em>2003).

The following management actions for the conservation of this species are needed: wild population management, monitoring, public education, and limiting factor management (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>The Himalayan Langur Project, established in 2012, is working across Chamba, with local communities and other stakeholders to establish a holistic conservation program and research on the langur. At present, the project is working with farmers around the Khajjiar-Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary to establish sustainable, non-lethal crop-raid deterrents and crop protection strategies (Anandam <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2013b).<br/><br/>In Jammu-Kashmir, the species occurs in the following protected areas:&#160;Dachigam NP, Wangat-Naranag CR (District Ganderbal), Kazinag NP (Baramulla District), Rajparian WS (Anantnag District), Overa WS (Pahalgam District), and Tral WS (Pulwama District).</p><p></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

A population reduction of more than 80% over three generations (39 years) is estimated, including a period of four years in the past and projected forwards for the next 35 years, due mainly to a decline in habitat quality as well as unsustainable levels of exploitation. The total population size was estimated between 260 and 330 individuals, which, according to new data from China (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012; Guangsong <em>et al.</em> 2014), is probably an underestimate. Based on the interviews with hunters (Momberg <em>et al. </em>2010), at least 13 Burmese Snub-nosed Monkeys were hunted during 2009. It is predicted that hunting pressure on the Myanmar side (directed and undirected) is likely to increase considerably in the next few years as new dam construction and logging roads invade the distribution area of this species.</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-IN"">The distribution area is mountainous, and slopes are very steep in most places. The main forest types in the range of the Snub-nosed Monkeys are cool temperate rain forest and mixed temperate forest. Silver fir forest occurs at elevations of 2,745-3,660 m (conifer zone). There is no information how high up the mountains the monkeys go, but the highest mountain in this range is 3,660 m. According to local hunters, Snub-nosed Monkeys spend the summer (i.e., the snow-free times from May to October) mostly at higher altitudes, in mixed temperate forests and conifer forests. In winter, however, when snowfall probably restricts the availability of food, the monkeys descend to lower elevations and may be found closer to villages.</p><p><span lang=""EN-IN"">Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2019) identified 14 plant species and four lichen species consumed by&#160;<em>Rhinopithecus strykeri</em>. In addition, two captive individuals of this species were provided with a cafeteria diet composed of &gt; 600 wild-collected plant species that were gathered from known&#160;<em>R. strykeri</em><em>&#160;</em>habitats. This exercise was conducted to determine which plant species and food items were considered palatable by this species. The captive monkeys freely consumed a variety of plant products including young and mature leaves, fruits/seeds, buds, flowers, twigs, and bark from 170 different species of trees, bushes, and herbs representing 76 genera and 41 plant families, as well as 15 species of lichen. Both the wild monkeys and captive monkeys preferred and consumed the same food items.&#160;</span></p><p>Food plants consumed by&#160;<em>R. strykeri&#160;</em>are mainly found in intact subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests and hemlock-broadleaf mixed forests at an altitude of 2,200–3,000 m (Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2019). Known to feed on bamboo shoots. Diurnal, arboreal and terrestrial in habit. Sympatric with various macaques, Shortridge’s langur (<em>Trachypithecus shortridgei</em>), Bengal Slow Loris (<em>Nycticebus bengalensis</em>), and Eastern Hoolock Gibbon (<em>Hoolock leuconedys</em>).

Animals are hunted and trapped for their bones and heads, but most often monkeys are unintentionally trapped in iron traps that are set to trap deer or wild pigs to supply the local bush meat trade (this has been confirmed by local hunters and there is camera trap evidence of the monkeys travelling on the ground where traps have been set) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Already with the still limited construction work camps, commercial bush meat demand  has increased sharply over the last two years (2010-2011) and is set to accelerate (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Monkeys may also be caught in traps set for bears (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation, due to the creation of roads and other infrastructure is rapidly becoming a major threat. Logging roads have now been built into all the areas occupied by this species since 2009 (some are within 200 m of the camera traps) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). With the increased access, the influx of Chinese workers to the area as part of the logging and dam building operations is accelerating and it is expected that when the dams reach the full construction stage there will be at least 10,000 workers employed in this area (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat loss due the impacts of logging is very serious due to large scale mechanical logging (blasting of logging roads, use of heavy equipment and winches, reaching ridges and even peaks) taking place, especially as the largest part of the range area is conifer forest and during the snow-covered winter months the Snub-nosed Monkeys (just as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">R. bieti</span>) depend on lichens for food (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). As the logging is effecting most mature conifer trees, food sources especially in winter are becoming scarce. The logging practices are causing serious destruction because logging takes place at high altitudes and even on slopes with more than 70 degrees slope inclination (these areas are accessed using winches and roads are blasted through cliffs). Land slides are becoming increasingly common as a result of the loss of tree cover. The&#160; lower mountain broad leaf forest is also impacted by logging (targeting hardwoods) and landslides caused by logging roads. Shifting cultivation reaches from the N'mai Hka river valley up to 2,000 meters, flooding following dam construction will displace shifting cultivation areas in the valley bottom to higher areas, increasing the pressures on the Snub-nosed Monkey habitat (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).<p><span lang=""EN-IN"">At present, the conservation status of the monkey in China remains unclear. Hunting&#160;remains a threat as understood from the hunting tools in use in the community around the habitat. In one instance, <em>R. strykeri</em> was reared as pet.</p><p>Given the various projects coming up in the species’ range, and based on the ongoing (over the last 10 years) and increasing levels of hunting and habitat loss, it is suspected that the species will undergo rapid declines of over 80% in the future, especially then next 30-35 years.</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-IN"">Geissmann&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that there are approximately three to four groups of&#160;Burmese Snub-nosed Monkeys, which occur in three distinct parts of the distribution area around Maw River. The first group, distributed north of the Maw River, contains approximately 60-80 individuals; the second group, south of the river has about 80-100 individuals; and a group of about 150 animals appears at the foothills of the snow-capped mountains above the Chichitago village. The total population size was estimated at 260-330 individuals. Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018) found a breeding group of &gt; 70 individuals on the eastern slopes of the Gaoligong mountains in the Salween River Basin. <br/><br/>The generation length of Snub-nosed Monkeys is unknown, however, Geissmann&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011) used the age at first reproduction as a minimum estimate of generation length. In other species of Snub-nosed Monkeys, the average age at first reproduction is 4–6 years in females and 6.5–7 years in males (Li&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2003; Liang&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2000; Quan and Xie, 2002, cited in Liu&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2009; Zou, 2002, cited in Cui&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2008). The generation length is derived as 13 years for the species.</p><p><span lang=""EN-IN"">After two years of field work in this area the only direct encounters with this species were by local support staff (twice) and not by any scientists and the presence of the species in the wild was only confirmed through camera traps (one group of eleven including three mothers with infants, and two individual animals on three camera traps in total) over a nine-month period (F.

Preliminary surveys and notes on habitat associations indicate that the range of the new species encompasses the mountain forests in the watershed area of the Maw River, a tributary to the N'mai Hka River, and forests across the range to the east above the village of Chichitago. The species therefore appears to be limited in distribution to a small area of the SalweenN'mai Hka divide in northeastern Kachin state, northeastern Myanmar.

It prefers fir larch forest between the Yangtze and Mekong Rivers (Long <em>et al.,</em> 1994). At Bamei, in northern Yunnan Province, it was found to live primarily in cypress forests (Zhong <em>et al</em>., 1998). It is mainly folivorous, though Kirkpatrick <em>et al. </em>(2001) report that lichens are also an important part of its diet in the northern part of its range.

Lichens make up the most of the diet (67%) but in Jinsichang, bamboo leaves make the most of the diet. The diet is variable through the seasons and these monkeys are known to feed of bird nestlings and clay as well (described as geophagy).   </p><p>Mating peak season (August-September); birthing (March-May). Gestation: 189-198days. In captivity, the monkeys have a birth interval of c. 2 years. Infant mortality in the first ‘harsh’ winter is 55-60% as also reflected in the high female-infant ratio. Males were more terrestrial than female (Xiang <em>et al</em>., 2009). Females spend more time feeding (44.8%) than males (39.5%), juveniles(39.1%) and infants (14.2%). (Li&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2015).Scavenging and begging thereafter was observed in Yunnan,China. Two females of a habituated group was food biting and tearing in freshly killed birds (Ren <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Grueter <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported altitudinal range use in Samage Forest, Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve, Yunnan, PRC and found that the monkeys ranged from a maximum of 3,550 m in July to 3,060 m in April. The monkeys were seen to exploit high altitude lichens during extreme winters when high nutrition food was lacking (Grueter <em>et al</em>., 2012).   </p><p>Diurnal, arboreal and terrestrial. They are known to use dark conifer forests, higher up the valleys over consecutive nights.

A preliminary PVA using Vortex found that five smallest subpopulations are at risk of declines and extinction in the next 100 years from effects inbreeding and poaching, while five largest subpopulations were considered more secure (Xiao <em>et al. </em>2005). The species is also threatened by habitat loss, especially from logging. Since 1999, when a ban stopped most commercial logging in the region, habitat loss has slowed, but it is still a large potential threat in the future. Clearing of forest land for summer grazing pasture had decreased suitable habitat for the monkeys by 31% between 1958 and 1997 (Xiao <em>et al. </em>2003). In addition, fires set for agriculture are a threat to some of the areas, particularly in Tibetan Autonomous Region. A subpopulation of about 50 individuals in one area was apparently extirpated due to pesticide spraying for control of forest pests (Zhong Tai in litt.)</p>  <p>In Laojan, Yunnan, poaching remains to be the primary threat to the species. This is a real challenge as the communities in the area practice a strong tradition of hunting, as are the other communities within this monkey's range: Yi, Lisu, Tibetan, Pumi, Naxi, Bai, Molimosuo, and Han. Despite the hunting ban, snares and traps continue to threaten the species. The low reproductive rate of the species does not really help with the hunting pressure (Li <em>et al</em>. 2009).      </p>","In 2006 the total known population was estimated at less than 2,000, with less than 1,000 mature individuals.

Although this species is not usually targeted for bushmeat hunting due to its ""foul-taste"", it is shot when encountered, and consumed or used in traditional ""medicine"" (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006). It has been found in trade in China, where it may be used for ""medicinal"" purposes (Nadler pers. comm.), although this is likely to be limited activity. With the exception of the Khau Ca forest population, there is high hunting pressure in the area where it lives, as evidenced by several gunshots heard almost daily during field trips (2004-2005) in the Na Hang Nature Reserve (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006) and observations of hunters camps (Thach Mai Hoang 2011). Shifting and settled cultivation, as well as other land development activities, also pose a threat (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Le Xuan Canh 2006, Le Khac Quyet <em>et al</em>. 2007, Covert <em>et al</em>. 2008, Le Khac Quyet and Covert 2010). In the past, excessively intense and unsustainable legal and illegal logging and gold mining were the biggest threats. Recently, the development of a hydroelectric power project along the Gam River in Na Hang has seriously impacted its habitat, plus the sudden increases in human populations, especially construction workers, have led to increased demand for meat, and thus increased hunting pressure (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana, 2006). At the present time, hunting pressure continues to be high in Na Hang. In the Tung Vai area the largest threat is extensive cardamom cultivation and the population at Khau Ca is primarily threatened by an ongoing low level of habitat degradation.","<p>Tonkin Snub-nosed Monkey has recently been observed in Na Hang Nature Reserve in Tuyen Quang Province and in Khau Ca Forest and Tung Vai Forest in Ha Giang Province. It is also possible that it still occurs in Cham Chu Nature Reserve in Tuyen Quang (Le Khac Quyet and Covert 2010). A study of the Tat Ke sector of the Na Hang Nature Reserve in 1993 estimated a density of fewer than eight individuals/km² (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006). The latest study at this location, in 2009-2010, found far lower densities. It is thought that hunting pressure is the reason for low densities in Tat Ke Sector. The highest estimate for any one population was in the Ban Bung sector of the Na Hang Nature Reserve, at between 90 and 110 individuals in 1992 (Ratajszczak <em>et al</em>. 1992). There has been significant population decline in both sectors of the Na Hang Nature Reserve, Tat Ke and Ban Bung (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006, Thach Mai Hoang 2011). Understanding of the number or the size of the subpopulations, with the exception of Khau Ca, is poor: with estimate of <em>ca</em> 20 individuals in Na Hang Nature Reserve (Thach Mai Hoang 2011); lack of recent observations at Cham Chu Nature although it may still occur at this site (Dong Thanh Hai <em>et al</em>. 2006); 130 individuals confirmed in the Tonkin Snub Nosed Monkey Species/Habitat Conservation Area at Khau Ca (Le Khac Quyet, pers. obs. 2015); and possibly 30-40 individuals in Tung Vai forest of Quan Ba District, Ha Giang Province, close to Chinese-Vietnamese border (Nguyen Van Truong 2012).

This decline is largely the result of hunting pressure throughout its range and some habitat loss in the north. The species, like other African colobines, is large-bodied and very easy to hunt. With human populations increasing in the region, and the vastly increased access into once-remote forest, this pressure is unlikely to abate in the near future. The subspecies <em>Colobus satanas satanas,</em> found only on the island of Bioko (Equatorial Guinea), is even more at risk from hunting and has a geographic range of only 464&#160;km²; it is assessed separately as Critically Endangered (see <a href=""https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/40008/17983018""><em>Colobus satanas satanas</em></a>).</p>","<p>This species inhabits coastal evergreen, lowland moist, montane and swamp forests. It is typically found high in the canopy of dense, primary rainforest, and is now only present in protected or undisturbed inaccessible areas. It appears unable to survive in secondary forest, and is rare or absent in forests where logging has reduced canopy height.<br/><br/><em>Colobus satanas</em> is a highly arboreal, diurnal species. Like other colobines, they eat seeds and leaves (seeds being around 50-60% of the diet: Fleury and Brugière 2013). This species lives in groups averaging 13 individuals (range 5–30) and has an annual home range of between 70–570 ha (Fleury and Brugière 2013). They are often found in polyspecific troops with guenons and mangabeys.</p>","<p><em>Colobus satanas</em> is directly threatened by habitat loss and hunting throughout its range, and indirectly by increasing human populations and the creation of easy access routes into almost all previously remote forests. Human population growth in the range states of the taxon is roughly 2.7% annually and will not slow down for several decades (UN 2019, World Bank 2019).<br/><br/>Road access into once-remote forests – even around protected areas – has increased hugely over the last 20–30 years (Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007), facilitating increased hunting and transport of bushmeat to both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>Black Colobus meat is consumed locally and traded commercially in urban areas. This species is very easy for gun-hunters to kill, being rather slow-moving, and is sought after due to its high body weight (Brugière 1998, Kumpel <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>In the northwest of its range, in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, the species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. (2016). Forest loss is relatively low in the Gabon parts of this taxon’s range and the small area in Congo where it occurs (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013) due to historically low human population densities and use of selective logging techniques as opposed to clearcutting. However, there is an ongoing trend for gradually increasing annual forest loss since 2001 in all four range states, especially since 2013 (GFW 2019). Forest loss will increase greatly in the future as industrial-scale agriculture expands, removing forests suitable for various forest-obligate species (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Recorded population densities on the mainland range from 7 to 30 individuals/km² (Fleury and Brugière 2013) and, even in unhunted areas, habitat type appears to have a major influence. Density was 11 individuals/km² in mature forest (Brugière 1998) and 30 individuals/km² in gallery forest in Lopé, Gabon (Harrison 1986). In 2011, Black Colobus were recorded only seven times in transect surveys that covered the whole of mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni), an effort of 231 km and encounter rate of only 0.03 groups/km (Ruffler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Surveys in unhunted, undisturbed habitats have shown encounter rates an order of magnitude higher (0.3 groups/km) (Fleury and Brugière 2013). The most recent survey in Lopé (2008) produced an encounter rate on transects of 0.23 groups/km (A. Bezangoye and F. Maisels unpub. data 2010).<br/><br/>Immediately outside the same park in a logging concession, encounter rate on transects was over 70% lower: 0.07 groups/km (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2008). Across their range, Black Colobus are entirely or almost absent from large areas with otherwise suitable habitat, due to decades of heavy hunting pressure. The situation on Bioko is of particular concern. There are probably fewer than 1,250 animals remaining, and Cronin <em>et al</em>. (in review) estimated &gt;80% decline in numbers between 1986 and 2016 (<em>ca</em> 3 generations).<span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>",Decreasing,"<a name=""_GoBack""></a>This species occurs in Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon in tropical moist forest. There are two subspecies: <em>Colobus satanas satanas</em> on the island of Bioko (part of Equatorial Guinea) and <em>C. s. anthracinus</em> on the mainland. The northern limit of its distribution is the left bank of the Sanaga River in Cameroon, and the southern limit is unknown, but likely somewhere around 2° S. The eastern limit is likewise ill-defined, and could be the upper Ogooué and lower Ivindo rivers (both in Gabon) at roughly 12° E, but there are records from up to about 14° E in both the Mwagna National Park in Gabon (Moussavou Makanga 2009) and Garabinzam area in northwestern Congo (Ella Akou and Moussavou Makanga 2010, Mbolo 2010). This species is now rare or absent in those parts of its range where there has been extensive logging. On mainland Equatorial Guinea, its range had been reduced to one-third of its former size by 1967 and these monkeys are now exceedingly rare (Ruffler <em>et al</em>. 2012). On Bioko, approximately 95% of the population lives in two of the island’s protected areas (Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve and Pico Basilé National Park). In the Dja Biosphere Reserve in Cameroon, despite an intensive survey in 2015 (over 500 km of effort), no black colobus were seen at all (whilst <em>C. guereza</em> were reasonably common) (MINFOF/UICN, 2015).","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Black Colobus meat is consumed in rural areas and traded commercially in urban areas.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES.<br/><br/><em>Colobus satanas</em><em> </em>occurs in many of the protected areas in its range, including one World Heritage Site: Lopé (Gabon).

17944855,5144,Colobus polykomos,Endangered,A2bcd,2020,2019-06-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Colobus polykomos&#160;</em>is listed as Endangered as it is estimated that the population has undergone a decline exceeding 50% over the past 30 years (or three generations), based on the evidence that habitat degradation, human population growth and intense hunting are taking place across its range, and that the species does not persist in degraded areas, requiring at least some mature forest. Habitat destruction and degradation have occurred across the range of C. <em>polykomos</em> in Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Each of these countries lost between 14% and 21% of their total forest cover between 2001 and 2017, and the drivers of forest loss continue to operate (www.globalforestwatch.org). In addition, human populations in these countries increased by 120%. Commercial logging and subsistence hunting are common across the range countries, and the development of large-scale mining, logging and industrial agricultural concessions in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are having devastating effects on wildlife (WCF 2014, 2015; Tweh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Laws against hunting and other illegal activities in protected areas are poorly enforced in all countries in the species' range. As a result, during the last three decades, the King Colobus has disappeared from the majority of the protected areas in which it once occurred and now occurs only in a limited number of forests, usually at low densities. Based on the ongoing habitat degradation/fragmentation, poaching pressure, human population growth and the decline in forest cover, the total population of <em>C. polykomos </em>has declined by more than 50% during the last three generations.","<p>This species depends on rainforest and gallery forest; it is rarely found in degraded habitats, although sometimes occurs in secondary forests. <em>Colobus polykomos </em>usually forms small multi-male groups. In the Cantanhez Forest in Guinea-Bissau, groups consisted of 3–10 individuals, while at Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary in Sierra Leone, one habituated group had nine members (Dasilva 1989). Lone individuals have also been observed. At Tiwai, it associates with the Western Red Colobus (<em>Piliocolobus badius badius</em>). Mean group size of the Taï population is 15 (range 12–19) (Korstjens 2001, Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002). In Mt. Nimba, Liberia, it associates with the Diana Monkey (Galat and Galat-Luong 2000). Low mtDNA diversity indicates that female philopatry and male dispersal is common in this species (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). Dasilva (1994) studied the diet of <em>C. polykomos </em>in the mid-1990s at Tiwai and found that 30% of feeding time was spent eating leaves and seeds. In Taï, this species is more frugivorous than the sympatric red colobus and Olive Colobus monkeys (Korstjens <em>et al</em>. 2007).<em><br/><br/>Colobus polykomos </em>c<span class=""datalabel1"">an live in high altitude areas. Individuals were observed at montane areas at 673–1,061 m in the Fouta Djallon region in Guinea (C. Alonso and A. Hernansaiz&#160;<span class=""datalabel1"">pers. obs. 2014).</span></p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>The primary threat to the survival of <em>Colobus polykomos </em>is uncontrolled hunting for bushmeat throughout its range, coupled with forest loss, degradation and fragmentation. The Upper Guinean rainforest is a highly fragmented system and remains one of the most severely threatened forest systems in the world. From 2001 to 2017, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau respectively lost 7.2%, 14%, 21% and 12% of their forest cover (Global Forest Watch 2019). The forest cover of these five countries declined from 321,680 km²&#160;in 1990 to 300,540&#160;km²&#160;in 2015, a loss of 21,680&#160;km²&#160;(7%) (FAO 2015). Based on World Bank data (2019), the human population in these countries increased from 30.5 million inhabitants in 1987 to 67.0 million in 2017, an increase of 120%. Habitat encroachment for agricultural purposes occurs throughout the range countries even inside protected areas. In Cote d'Ivoire &gt;80% of the protected areas have been converted to plantations (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015). The secondary threats are forest loss, degradation and fragmentation.<br/><br/>Hunting is common across the range countries of <em>C. polykomos</em>. In the Tai National Park in Cote d'Ivoire, where the largest subpopulation of this species remains, several studies have documented the impacts of hunting (Refisch and Kone 2005, McGraw 2007,&#160;Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2008). A local bushmeat market survey conducted by Covey and McGraw (2014) on the Liberia-Cote d'Ivoire border found that <em>C. polykomos</em> represented 11.4% of the primate carcasses for sale. A nationwide survey in Liberia found that signs of hunting were the most frequently encountered anthropogenic threat recorded, with a rate of 1.32 signs per km (Tweh <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The development of large-scale mining, logging and industrial agricultural concessions in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea threatens all wildlife (WCF 2014, 2015; Tweh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Colobus polykomos </em>has declined across its geographic range.<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Taï National Park probably sustains the largest population remaining in all the range countries. A survey by Zuberbühler and Jenny (2002) in Taï NP estimated the population density at 35.5 individuals per km² in research areas. Line transect survey data collected by Covey (2009) at the same site indicated a decline of 30% (1.62 group/km², equivalent to 25 individuals/km².&#160;Inside Taï&#160;NP but outside the research area, the species has become very rare (Covey 2009). With the exception of Taï, the species has been extirpated in more than 95% of the protected areas in Cote d'Ivoire where it previously occurred. During a 2007–2010 monitoring survey in the Cavally FR, the species was reported at a very low encounter rate (0.02 group/km; WCF 2010). The ongoing hunting pressure, habitat encroachment and human settlement within such forest reserves pose severe threats to the survival of these remaining populations.<br/><br/>In Guinea, <em>C. polykomos</em> has been extirpated in several localities, including protected areas. In the Boke region, a 2005 RAP survey (Eriksson and Kpoghomou 2006) found no evidence of the species' presence, although it was formerly reported from the region by local people. A rapid survey of primates conducted from November to December 2015 also failed to find evidence of the species in the CGB-Halco concession (WCF 2015). Surveys conducted between April 2012 and February 2014 confirmed the presence of <em>C. polykomos </em>in the Lebekere sub-prefecture, in the northern sector of the Fouta Djallon mountain range. The ongoing loss and fragmentation of this habitat suggest that the population is in decline (Fernandez-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In Guinea-Bissau, the species occupies patches of forest where anthropogenic habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and poaching pressure are high (Minhós&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In Cantanhez National Park in southwestern Guinea-Bissau, Minhós&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2013) estimated an effective population size of 251–575 based on an analysis of the mtDNA hypervariable region (HVR). A 2015 recce survey in Dulombi National Park reported the presence of the species at a low encounter rate of 0.33 groups/km (Bersacola<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018). The presence of&#160;<em>C. polykomos</em>&#160;in the Boe region has been reported in&#160;a 2013 survey (Hoogveld 2013).<br/><br/>In Liberia, the species has already been depleted in most protected and unprotected areas. Subsistence and commercial hunting pressure have increased during the last decade and illegal gold mining threatens the future of protected areas (Tweh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). In Nimba County, north-central Liberia, Bene&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2013a) reported that they did not encounter any hunters carrying carcasses of this species in their market visits, indicating that it has been depleted in most, if not all forests in this area.&#160;<em>C. polykomos</em>&#160;was not observed during a recce survey conducted in November-December 2011 in the forest patches of the Sime Darby concession covering four counties (Gbarpolu, Bomi, Bong and Grand Cape Mount)&#160;(Bene&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013b). During a 2014 biomonitoring survey in the Grebo-Krahn National Park, the species was encountered at a very low rate (0.08 groups/km; WCF 2014). During another survey conducted from January-August 2017 in the Krahn-Bassa National Forest,&#160;<em>C. polykomo</em>s was also encountered at a very low rate (0.03 groups/km; WCF 2017). In Sapo National Park, a 10-month biomonitoring survey conducted in 2002 yielded a mean average sighting rate of 0.13/km, with a decrease in the monthly average recording of this species (Waitkuwait 2003). The species was heard twice in North Loma National Forest and sighted three times in the Grebo National Forest during a Rapid Assessment Program survey conducted from 16 November to 12 December 2005 in North Loma National Forest, Gola National Forest and Grebo National Forest (Barrie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone<em>,&#160;</em>insufficient data are available to assess the current status of this species. Nevertheless, indications are that it is very rare and its distribution patchy (Brncic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). In Gola National Forest Park,&#160;<em>C.</em>&#160;<em>polykomos&#160;</em>was encountered in the course of wildlife surveys&#160;made&#160;before and after the 1991–2001 civil war (Davies 1987, Klop&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Lindsell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011),&#160;but the use of different survey methods, and the manner in which auditory and visual encounter data are presented in their reports, make it impossible to gauge with precision any changes in&#160;population numbers. In a nationwide survey of chimpanzees conducted from January 2009 to May 2010,&#160;<em>C. polykomos</em>&#160;was encountered or reported in the Kambui Hills Forest Reserve, the Kangari Hills Forest Reserve, the Loma Mountains National Park, the Nimini Hills Forest Reserve, the Outamba-Kilimi National Park, the Tingi Hills Fotrest Reserve and the Western Area Forest Reserve (Brncic 2011). The species also occurs in the Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary (Dasilva 1989), a site which was not included in Brncic's survey.<br/><br/>In southeastern Senegal, no study to date has confirmed the presence of&#160;<em>C. polykomos</em>, although this species is expected to occur along the Guinean coast (Oates&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008)</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Colobus polykomos </em>is found in West Africa, from southern Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, to the Sassandra River in Côte d’Ivoire (Kingdon 1997, Groves 2005). <em>Colobus p. dollmani</em><em> </em>is probably a hybrid between <em>C. polykomos </em>and <em>C. vellerosus</em><em> </em>that occurred in the narrow contact between the Bandama and the Sassandra rivers, but is probably now extinct (<span class=""datalabel1"">Gonedelé Bi pers. obs. 2015).",Uncontrolled hunting throughout the range for bushmeat and the commercial bushmeat trade.,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Colobus polykomos </em>is listed as Class A under the African Convention and under Appendix II of CITES.

Rigorous law enforcement against poaching in protected areas is needed to ensure the survival of this species; permanent research stations in protected areas would greatly assist conservation efforts.<br/><br/>Although <em>C. polykomos</em> is found at very low densities in many of the forests where it still occurs, accurate estimates of the size and density of these populations are needed. Systematic surveys should be conducted in Grebo-Krahn NP in Liberia, Gola Rainforest NP and Loma Mountains NP in Sierra Leone, Cantanhez and Dulombi NP in Guinea-Bissau.

Numbers are estimated to have declined by over 70% (but probably less that 80%) over the past three generations (36 years), and based on the continuing threats it is predicted to decline at the same rate over the next one generation in the future at least.","This species is associated with riparian-riverine forests, coastal lowland forest, including mangroves, peat swamp, and freshwater swamp forest (Boonratana 2000). It rarely ranges far from its local habitat's waterway (Meijaard and Nijman 2000). It has been suggested that it is restricted to the coastal areas and areas near rivers because the interior has soils that are low in minerals and salts, which are a necessary part of its diet (Bennett and Sebastian 1988). It is found at low elevations, up to no more than about 350 m asl (Meijaard and Nijman 2000).<br/><br/>The species is mostly folivorous (about 52% of all feedings) and frugivorous (about 40% of all feedings), and prefers young leaves and unripened non-fleshy fruits. Monthly diet of this species changes with availability throughout the year (Yeager 1989). Boonratana (2000) observed this species swimming across the Kinabatangan River in northern Borneo, and frequently across its tributaries. The home range size of a focal one-male group was 220.5 ha (Boonratana 2000). Boonratana (2000) reports that this species never entered agricultural lands, nor areas used intermittently as log dumps for logging operations carried out in the area before and during the study. This species returned to the river every night at the study site of Sukau, moving inland during the day (Boonratana 2000). It avoids areas with heavy deforestation, such as agricultural land (Salter and MacKenzie 1985). Where there is no hunting the species can persist in disturbed forests and secondary habitats.","Because of this species' association with riverine and coastal habitat, the major cause for its recent decline is thought to be habitat destruction. People favour these animals' habitats for logging, cultivation, and settlement. The planned land use for Central Kalimantan cited by E. Meijaard illustrates this tendency, with much of the riverine forest being marked for conversion. Clearing riverbanks and mangroves has a significant impact. Forest fires, especially those along the rivers, have a major impact on distribution. The 1997-1998 Bornean forest fires were thought to have destroyed the greatest proportion of remaining habitat of any primate in Kalimantan.<br/><br/>The species is relatively lethargic and easily hunted; with little effort entire populations can be hunted to extirpation. Opportunistic hunting of <em>Nasalis larvatus</em> for food occurs; the species is also hunted for bezoar stones, an intestinal secretion used in traditional Chinese medicine. Hunting has been felt most significantly in the Bornean interior, but is increasing in coastal areas (Meijaard and Nijman 2000).","In Sarawak, less than 1,000 animals are thought to remain in patchily distributed populations. In Sabah, the only remaining large populations are in the Kinabatangan flood plain, and around Dewurst Bay in the Eastern Deltas. Brunei estuaries support one population. The species is in greater abundance in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), where Meijaard surveyed the population. The Indonesian populations range in size from over 1,000 to less than 100, depending on past and current threats (Meijaard and Nijman 2000). The Pulau Kaget Nature Reserve population in South Kalimantan has reportedly been extinct since 1997 (Meijaard and Nijman 2000). Also, the population in the Mahakam Delta, East Kalimantan which would have numbered in the thousands up until the early 1990s, has now been decimated due to conversion of the coastal swamps to shrimp farms (E.

17945536,4225,Cercopithecus petaurista,Near Threatened,A2cd+4cd,2020,2017-07-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Cercopithecus petaurista</em> is listed as Near Threatened as this species is facing serious threats from habitat loss and hunting, although it can persist in a wide variety of degraded habitats as long as hunting is minimal. Increasing hunting pressure on this smaller-bodied monkey is inferred from rising rates of human population growth and habitat loss in its West African range countries, but overall population decline is probably less than, but approaching, 30% over the last 33 years (three generations). However, unless conservation efforts within its range improve significantly <em>C. petaurista</em> is likely to qualify for a Vulnerable threat status before long, and in some parts of its range it is already Endangered. In Togo, in particular, it probably qualifies already for Vulnerable status and may be nationally Endangered.","<em>Cercopithecus petaurista</em> occurs in primary and secondary forests, gallery forest, swamp forest, mangrove forest, forest-savanna mosaic landscapes, and regenerating areas such as farm bush. This species is often associated with liana tangles and climbers that surround large tree trunks (Oates 2011). The highest altitude that this species inhabits appears to be ≥ 1,000 m asl in the mature rainforest on Mt. Bintumani in the Loma Mountains, Sierra Leone (T.S. Jones unpublished data cited in Grubb <em>et al.</em> 1998; A. Barrie pers. comm. 2016). <em>Cercopithecus petaurista</em> lives in 7-16 member one-male groups in Täi National Park, Côte d’Ivoire (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985, Buzzard 2006); seasonal male influxes sometimes occur that temporarily create multi-male groups. In Togo, average group size is 6.8 (range = 2-10, N=5); however, in Danyi Yikpa and Missahohe forest reserves in Togo, the size of two observed groups was quite large (20 and 30 individuals) (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Täi National Park quadrupedal walking (about 60%) dominates the locomotor repertoire of this species, followed by climbing, leaping and running, and it uses the middle to low strata of the forest canopy, lower than sympatric <em>Cercopithecus diana</em> and higher than <em>Cercopithecus campbelli</em>; the average canopy height used was 13.3 m (McGraw 2000). In the same forest, Galat and Galat-Luong (1985) found that the majority of the species’ diet came from fruits (77.2%), with few leaves (5.5%) and insects (7.7%); Buzzard (2006), however, found that this species was less frugivorous (34.4%) and more folivorous (40%) than the sympatric <em>Cercopithecus campbelli</em> and <em>Cercopithecus diana</em>. This species is preyed upon by the Western <a>chimpanzee (<em>Pan troglodytes verus</em>), leopard (</a><em>Panthera pardus</em>)<em> </em>and crowned-hawk eagle&#160;(<em>Stephanoaetus coronatus</em>).<br/><br/>It is suspected that there is a continuing decline in habitat area, extent, and quality. The continued conversion of the forests inhabited by this species&#160;into agricultural land and especially plantations of cash crops have been occurring. Between 1975 and 2013 (38 years), Côte d’Ivoire lost 60 % (22,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of its forest while Ghana lost 24 % (4,000 km<sup>2</sup>) due mainly to conversion into cocoa, oil palm and rubber plantations (CILSS 2016). One good example is Marahoué National Park in Côte d’Ivoire that experienced almost total conversion of the forest into plantations. This park experienced a 93% reduction in forest cover between 2002 and 2008 (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008), and this has led to the extirpation of all the anthropoid primate species, including <em>C. petaurista</em>. However, the overall rate of population decline is probably less than 30%.","The primary threat to the lesser spot-nosed monkey is uncontrolled hunting, which is increasingly targeting smaller-bodied primates such as this species throughout the range countries (Oates 2011; Danquah et al. 2012; Soiret et al. 2019), despite the relatively high cost of shotgun ammunition. Due to its small body size, <em>C. petaurista</em> was not a major target of hunting until recently, but because the populations of larger-bodied primates such as the colobines and mangabeys have been greatly reduced or even extirpated from many forests due to uncontrolled hunting, even this small-bodied monkey (adult male ~ 4.5 kg; adult female 2.3-2.9 kg) is now a target for hunters. In Mount Nimba, Liberia, hunters were found carrying the carcasses of this species at a high frequency (0.81 per km) while hunters’ hauls contained no larger-bodied primates, probably because they have become extremely rare or extirpated (Bené <em>et al.</em> 2013). Also, in Dassioko Sud Forest Reserve in Côte d’Ivoire, only small-bodied primates including the lesser-spot nosed monkey were the only primates hunted (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2016). Habitat loss, habitat degradation, and habitat fragmentation are other threat factors. In Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, large-scale and small-scale conversion of forests into cash-crop plantations have <a>reduced</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160; the forest cover by about 15% of the former extent in the last twenty years (Global Forest Watch 2014). Mining for gold, diamonds, bauxite, and other<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;minerals also threatens the species’ survival (E.D. Wiafe, pers. obs. 2016).</span>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Cercopithecus petaurista</em> is the smallest guenon in the Upper Guinea forest region (adult male weight = 4.4 kg, Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990). Until quite recently, because of its small body size and elusive behaviour made it a less attractive target for hunters than larger sympatric monkeys and it was, therefore, a relatively common and widespread species throughout its distribution range. Hunting pressure on all forest mammals in this region has continued to increase, however, and some protected areas no longer contain this species (e.g., Songan Forest Reserve in Côte d'Ivoire). The population density of this species in Täi National Park in Côte d'Ivoire has decreased from 29.3 individuals/km² in the 1980s to 21 individuals/km² in 2000–2001, representing a 28.8% reduction in population size (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985, Buzzard 2006). Although <em>C. petaurista</em> is the most frequently detected species on canopy cameras in Comoé National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, the average encounter rate of this species is low (0.1 group/km) in foot surveys conducted in forested areas of the park (R. Matsuda Goodwin pers. comm. 2020). Similarly, <em>C. petaurista</em> was also the most frequently detected species by cameras set in the canopy in the Tanoé-Ehy swamp forest in Côte d’Ivoire (D. Alempijevic&#160;pers. comm. 2019). However, according to Bitty et al. (2015) this species is no longer found at the following Forest Reserves in Côte d’Ivoire: Bolo-Ouest, Niégré, Monogaga, Marahoué, Rapide Grah, Haut Sassandra, Mont Péko, Bouaflé, Kani-Bandaman Rouge, Séguéla, Koba, Dé, Haut Dé, and Moyenne Marahoué. At Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Sierra Leone in the late 1980s, its population density was 59 individuals/km² (3.3–4.0 groups/km²) (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Gola Forest National Park, Sierra Leone, <em>C. petaurista</em> was encountered in the course of wildlife surveys made before and after the 1991–2001 civil war (Davies 1987, Klop <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lindsell <em>et al</em>. 2011), but the use of different survey methods, and the manner in which auditory and visual encounter data are presented in the reports of this work, make it impossible to gauge with precision any changes in population numbers. However, Lindsell <em>et al</em>. (2011) conclude that primates especially “continue to have healthy populations in the forest… and showed little or no sign of reduced abundance”. Data are inadequate to assess the current status of this species across the rest of Sierra Leone. In the proposed corridor areas that connect Grebo-Krahn National Park with Sapo National park in Liberia, this species was encountered at low rates (0.04 and 0.05 group/km) (Wild Chimpanzee Foundation 2015). Recent market surveys conducted in Konobo district of Liberia by Covey and McGraw (2014) indicate that in the absence (or near-absence) of many large-bodied primates, the smallest guenon has now become the most harvested species of all the primates. In Ghana, <em>C. petaurista </em>occurs in several forest reserves, such as Subri River, Cape 3 Points, Krokosua-Hills, and some community forests (e.g., Kwabre, Monkey-Hill) (Buzzard and Parker 2012, Wiafe and Amoah 2012, Osei <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Fazao-Malfakassa National Park, Togo, the rate of encounter with this species was 0.2 per km during a survey in 2014–2015 (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>",Decreasing,"Two subspecies of <em>Cercopithecus petaurista</em> are recognized.<em> Cercopithecus p. petaurista</em> is found in the moist forest zone east of the Cavally River in Côte d'Ivoire to the vicinity of the village of Souroukou and in Fazao-Malfakassa National Park, Danyi Yikpa and Missahohe forest reserves along the Kamassi River in western Togo. <em>C. p. buettikoferi</em> is found to the west of the Cavally River in Côte d’Ivoire to Guinea-Bissau’s Bijagos archipelago.","<p>The primary threat to the lesser spot-nosed monkey is uncontrolled hunting, which is increasingly targeting smaller-bodied primates such as this species throughout the range countries (Oates 2011; Danquah et al. 2012; Soiret et al. 2019), despite the relatively high cost of shotgun ammunition.

Strict enforcement of anti-poaching and snaring law in protected areas is needed in all of the species habitat countries. Protection could also be improved by the maintenance of more permanent research stations. In all range countries, the precise distribution range of this species is still unknown. For this reason, we recommend conducting extensive foot and camera-trap surveys in key protected areas. We also recommend more widespread studies of bushmeat in markets located in proximity of protected areas.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
17945814,4229,Cercopithecus sclateri,Endangered,A2cd,2019,2019-01-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered because Sclater’s Monkey is estimated to have undergone a population decline exceeding 50% over the past three generations (about 27 years, assuming a generation length of nine years),&#160;resulting from a decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality, and high levels of exploitation. This decline is projected to continue into the future, and its rate will probably intensify due to continuing widespread habitat loss and degradation and hunting.&#160;Additionally, the species does not occur in any officially gazetted wildlife conservation area. In large part, Sclater’s Monkey persists due to its small size, cryptic nature, adaptability and general non-preferred status among hunters relative to other monkeys. Close population monitoring should take place. However, such monitoring may be hampered by insecurity in the Niger Delta and in other parts of the species’ range and by the lack of an organised national programme in Nigeria focusing on Sclater’s Monkey.","<p>The original habitat of Sclater’s Monkey is moist tropical lowland forest, but due to severe habitat degradation, this species now persists in remnant secondary, gallery/riparian and freshwater swamp forests. The species is also found in marginal forest and farm-bush in communities where monkeys are regarded as sacred (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992, Tooze 1995, Baker 2005). Sclater’s Monkey is likely omnivorous, with a diet similar to other members of the <em>C. cephus</em> group: mostly fruits, insects and young foliage (Oates and Baker 2013).</p>","The rapidly growing human population of Nigeria is expected to be the third largest globally by 2050. This growth has been accompanied by widespread environmental degradation and will continue to negatively affect natural habitats. Across Nigeria, land area devoted to agriculture and plantations (crop and grazing lands, floodplain agriculture, irrigation and livestock projects, and tree and forest plantations) increased by nearly 84,000&#160;km²&#160;between 1976 and 1995. More than half of the country’s undisturbed lowland moist forest was lost during that same time frame (from 25,951 to 12,114                    km²) (Geomatics International <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160;From 1990–2015, net forest loss across Nigeria continued at a rate of 3.5% annually, resulting in a loss of ~4,100&#160;km²&#160;each year – more than any other African nation. During this period, Nigeria lost 59.4% of its forested area and 98.7% of its primary forest (FAO 2015). During the latter part of this period, from 2000–2015, the rate of forest loss across Nigeria accelerated (5%) (FAO 2015), and the percent of forest cover declined from 14.4% to 7.7% (World Bank 2017).&#160;Conversion of forested areas to farmland is a major contributor to this decline; for the decade ending in 2008, Nigeria converted more land to annual crops than did any other tropical nation (Phalan <em>et al.</em> 2013). The southeastern region of Nigeria, where Sclater’s Monkey occurs, has among the highest human population densities in the country and one of the highest in Africa. As a result, most natural forest across this species’ range has been converted to cultivated land; unregulated logging and activities associated with oil exploration and production have added to the destruction (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992, Baker and Olubode 2008). Of particular concern for Sclater’s Monkey is severe habitat fragmentation, resulting in a lack of connectivity among existing populations and associated loss of heterozygosity in population isolates.&#160;Additionally, the species does not occur in any official wildlife conservation area or have any effective protection from exploitation outside of the very few sites where it is protected by local communities owing to social taboos.","<p>Given widespread habitat loss across this species’ range, many of the remaining populations of Sclater’s Monkey are isolated, and most occur in&#160;highly&#160;degraded, unprotected forests. This degradation, combined with hunting pressure and lack of official protection, has led to decline of the population. The species’ persistence in southeastern Nigeria can be attributed to the species’ small size, shy nature and adaptability, and preferential hunting of larger-bodied primate taxa (Baker and Olubode 2008). Until the 1990s, Sclater’s Monkey was thought to be very rare, but extensive surveys since then have revealed its presence at a number of formerly unknown sites. In one regional survey, Baker and Olubode (2008) did not encounter any localities of recent extirpation (or sites where local reports indicated that populations of this species had been extirpated even though suitable habitat remains). Nevertheless, encounter rates were low: 0.18 detections per km surveyed.<br/><br/>In the very few sites where it is not hunted, or where hunting is less commonly practised (such as the Niger Delta where some communities rely on fish as their main protein source), this species may fare relatively well compared to larger primates. In the Edumanom Forest Reserve, a comparatively large forest block in the Niger Delta, one study found Sclater’s Monkey to be the most abundant diurnal primate encountered, occurring in an estimated 3.1 groups per&#160;km² (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011). In three village sites where Sclater’s Monkey is protected by social taboos&#160;(i.e. monkeys are not killed), populations appear to increase: 1) Lagwa, Imo State (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a); 2) Akpugoeze community complex, Enugu State (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2018); and 3) Ikot Uso Akpan, Akwa Ibom State (Eniang and Egwali 2011). However, the survival of these populations requires them to adapt to living in heavily deforested, urbanizing environments. Although apparently increasing, these populations are also relatively small: 178 individuals in Ikot Uso Akpan (Eniang and Egwali 2011), 206 individuals in Lagwa (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a), and 339 individuals in the Akpugoeze community complex (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to southern Nigeria. It ranges from the eastern Niger Delta in Bayelsa State east to the Cross River, and north to Enugu and Ebonyi States; the most northerly known populations occur in southern Anambra-Enugu States and central Ebonyi State (Baker and Olubode 2008). Sclater’s Monkey was feared extinct until it was sighted southwest of Oguta, Imo State, in 1988 (Oates and Anadu 1989). Additional populations were subsequently discovered in the early to mid-1990s (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992; Tooze 1995, 1996). In a 2004 regional survey, the species was located in several sites where it had not been previously recorded (Baker 2005, Baker and Olubode 2008). Across its range, this species has generally been recorded in fragmented, degraded forests (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1992, Tooze 1995, Baker and Olubode 2008).","Being the smallest diurnal primate across its range (along with <em>Cercopithecus erythrogaster</em>), Sclater’s Monkey has the lowest economic value as bushmeat relative to other diurnal primates. While it is sought after by hunters, some hunters consider the species more difficult to kill due to its size and cryptic nature, and some do not bother hunting Sclater’s Monkey given the lower profit it brings (Baker and Olubode 2008).",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is currently listed as Class B under the African Convention and under Appendix II of CITES.<br/><br/>There are no formally protected areas in the range of Sclater’s Monkey. Important conservation measures suggested by Baker (2005) include: 1) elevating the species to Schedule I of the Nigerian Endangered Species Act (this change may not be considered unless the species is elevated to CITES Appendix I); 2) raising awareness about the species and its uniquely Nigerian status through publicity and education; and 3) enhancing protection of key forests, including the Edumanom Forest Reserve in Bayelsa State, Upper Orashi Forest Reserve in Rivers State and the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve in Akwa Ibom State.<br/><br/>Communities where Sclater’s Monkey receives cultural protection (through social taboos) are also very important, although forest cover in these sites has been greatly reduced over time.&#160;These include Ikot Uso Akpan and other communities in the Itam region (Akwa Ibom State), Lagwa (Imo State) and the Akpugoeze community complex (Enugu State). In Lagwa and Akpugoeze, previous and existing conservation measures include school-based awareness programmes, stakeholder workshops,&#160;documentation and publishing of folklore and oral histories related to the cultural value of monkeys, and population and forest monitoring (Baker 2013; Baker <em>et al.</em> 2009; 2014a,b; 2018). Forest restoration and conservation awareness efforts have also been conducted in Ikot Uso Akpan (Jacob <em>et al.</em> 2013). Development of small-scale ecotourism in these communities should be explored, given how readily monkeys can be observed at these sites.<br/><br/>Other potential areas for enhanced protection are the Niger floodplain and Osomari Forest Reserve (Oates <em style=""font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.</em> 1992), as well as the Blue River (Azumini, Abia State) and Enyong Creek/Ikpa River (Akwa Ibom State) (Tooze 1995).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

This, combined with the effects of habitat loss, is believed to have caused a population decline in the order of 30% over the past (approximately three generations).","<p><em>Cercopithecus erythrotis</em> is an arboreal species found in lowland tropical forests. <em>Cercopithecus e. erythrotis</em> is found in lowland forests from sea level across the elevational gradient on Bioko through montane forests to the subalpine scrub zone found at the top of Pico Basilé at 3,011 m asl (Butynski and Kingdon 2013). Preferred habitat is primary lowland forests (e.g., southern and southwestern Bioko) (González-Kirchner 1996), where the monkey's abundance is at its highest (Cronin <em>et al.</em> 2016). The areas where it is present receive a gradient of rainfall from 2,000–10,000 mm, which include the ‘monsoon forests’ of southern Bioko (Oates <em>et al.</em> 2004).<em><br/><br/>Cercopithecus e. camerunensis</em> is also found predominantly in primary lowland tropical and submontane moist forest. It prefers mature forests to young secondary forests, probably to reduce competition with the Mona monkey (<em>C. mona</em>), which specialises in disturbed and edge forests (Oates 2011). The species feeds and travels lower in the canopy than other arboreal guenons (Oates 2011). In Cameroon, group sizes of about 4 to &gt;29 animals have been reported (Struhsaker 1969) and feeds on fruit, supplemented with leaves, shoots and arthropods (Gartlan, &amp; Struhsaker 1972, Zinner <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk33122773"">The major threats to <em>C. e. erythrotis</em> are hunting (e.g., Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2015a 2016), development and habitat degradation. </a>Between 1997 and 2010, 17,997 individuals were available for sale in the Malabo bushmeat market, which was by far the most of any primate species on the island (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Hunting has continued throughout Bioko, and the completion of a road bisecting the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve has eroded much of the isolation that had passively protected abundant wildlife populations, including <em>C. e. erythrotis</em>, in the remote Gran Caldera de Luba (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2015b, 2016), and has contributed to increased hunting activity in the reserve (D.T. Cronin, unpublished data, 2015-2016).<br/><br/>The major threats to <em>C. e. camerunensis</em> are also hunting for the bushmeat trade and habitat degradation. In 2004-2005 it was estimated that more than 1,025 carcasses were sold each year in three bushmeat markets in and around Korup National Park (Linder &amp; Oates 2011), and Fa <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimate that about 3511 individual <em>C. e. camerunensis</em> are sold annually in rural and urban markets across Cross–Sanaga rivers region. Around Banyang-Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary in Cameroon, <em>C. e. camerunensis</em> also accounted for 61% of all primates harvested in an eight-month period (Ajonina <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>","This species is a secretive, shy animal and therefore hard to detect. It is thought to persist over a large area of much of its historic range.

(Cronin, unpublished data). The population of <em>C. e. camerunensis </em>remains relatively poorly known. Given the threats faced by the species, it is suspected that there has been at least a 30% decline over the past three generations (assuming a 9 year generation period).<br/><br/>Range-wide population estimates and rates of offtake of <em>C. e. camerunensis</em> are unknown, as is its population size, but reports suggest that it is one of the most heavily hunted monkey species particularly because it feeds and travels in lower canopy than other forest guenons, making it susceptible to hunting (Ajonina et al. 2014; Fa el al. 2006; Linder and Oates 2011).",Decreasing,"This species has a restricted range from the Cross River in south-eastern Nigeria to just south of the Sanaga River in Cameroon.

In Nigeria, it occurs in Cross River National Park and Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary. Outside protected areas, it is found at several sites along the Cameroon-Nigeria border including Mawambi Hills, Mone Forest Reserve and the adjacent Mbulu-Mt. Oku Complex (in Cameroon), and Mbe Mountains, Iko Esai Forest and Ekuri Forest (in Nigeria). <em>Cercopithecus e. camerunensis</em> shares its habitat with many other endangered primates, including the Cross-River Gorilla (<em>Gorilla</em> <em>gorilla diehli</em>), the Nigeria-Cameroon Chimpanzee (<em>Pan troglodytes ellioti</em>), and the Drill (<em>Mandrillus leucophaeus</em>), and may indirectly benefit from conservation activities aimed at protecting these species. However, hunting levels remain high both inside and outside protected areas (e.g. Linder <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ajonina <em>et al</em>. 2014).

Furthermore, the hunting, sale, and consumption of primates was banned by Presidential Decree in October 2007 (Republic of Equatorial Guinea 2007), however, hunting pressure is intense and occurring throughout both protected areas (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2016; Grande-Vega <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2016).<br/><br/>The Bioko Biodiversity Protection Program have projects underway within the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve, including primate monitoring, alternative livelihoods, educational programs, professional development training (i.e., ecoguard training), the development of a Nature Center in the village of Ureca, and partnering with INDEFOR-AP to foment their active involvement in the reserve and its day-to-day management. A United Nations Development Programme – Global Environmental Facility project is also ongoing on the island with the goal of strengthening Equatorial Guinea’s system of protected areas. Work has also begun in Pico Basile National Park by the NGO, Ecoguinea, putting forth studies on socioeconomic factors driving bushmeat consumption in the villages bordering the park and other research (e.g., Grande-Vega <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2016).

This rate of decline is inferred from forest loss data (≥ 50% decline) in the last 25 years (almost three generations) and the declining encounter rates of the species in the Lama Forest of Benin (55.5% reduction), Okomu National Park (26.7% reduction), and in Niger Delta (&gt; 50% reduction) (see Population). A decline of at least 50% is also suspected based on the effects of high regional human population growth; the annual rate of increase in the human populations in Benin, Nigeria, and Togo between 1990 and 2016 was between <a style="""">2.0 and 3.5%&#160;</a>(World Bank Group 2019). This rising human population has increased habitat loss and hunting pressure. The rate of population decline in the <em>C. erythrogaster</em> population is expected to increase during the next decade unless major new conservation initiatives are taken.</p>","This species is found in primary, secondary and riverine lowland moist forest, semi-deciduous forest, and in swamp forest (Oates 2011). The secondary forest it inhabits includes seasonally-inundated forest (e.g., Eggua Royal Forest and Bola Camp in Nigeria; Lama Forest) and wetland forest (e.g., Togbota Forest, Benin) (Matsuda Goodwin 2007, pers. obs. 2015). The habitat of this species in Togodo Forest in Togo is mainly the relic forest dominated by large trees and lianas (Segniagbeto et al. 2017, 2018). The average group size is 5-9.6 in Benin (Campbell 2005, Kassa 2001, Matsuda Goodwin 2007), but was 10-20 (range 10-30) in southwestern Nigeria in the 1980s (Oates 1985); a more recent study in Okomu National Park, <a>Nigeria</a>&#160;by Akinsorotan et al. (2011) reported a smaller group size of 5-6. This species forms one-male multi-female groups. It is often<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;found in mixed-species groups with <em>C. mona</em> and sometimes found with the Olive Colobus (<em>Procolobus verus</em>) in the Lama Forest (Matsuda Goodwin 2007) and <em>C. mona</em> and <em>C. nictitans</em> in Okomu NP (Oates 1985). Most of the locomotion of <em>C. erythrogaster</em> is a combination of quadrupedal walking, running, and leaping. This species uses lower canopy levels and small to medium-sized supports (Oates 2011). In the Lama Forest, this species mainly feeds on ripe fruits, but during the dry season, it incorporates more unripe fruits (Matsuda Goodwin 2007).","<p>Most of the forest habitat in the range of this species has been heavily exploited and degraded, with much of it now converted to agricultural land (Sinsin <em>et al.</em> 2002, Oates 2011). Many of the forest areas where it still occurs are threatened by conversion in the relatively near future, and climate change could exacerbate the problem (FAO 2015). In the Niger Delta, forest degradation is mainly through large-scale artisanal extraction of commercial trees, rather than widespread conversion to farms. As larger-bodied monkeys such as the Niger Delta Red Colobus (<em>Piliocolobus epieni</em>), the White-thighed Colobus (<em>Colobus vellerosus</em>), and the Red-capped Mangabey (<em>Cercocebus torquatus</em>) are being depleted in the forests within the distribution range of this species, this small-bodied primate is now <a>increasingly hunted</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;for meat, although its secretive nature and habit of lurking in thick growth, especially in wetland habitat, provide it with some protection. A substantial increase in human population in the last three decades in the range countries <a>has led to </a>an increasing demand for bushmeat. Between 1990 and 2018, human population size increased by 131%, 106%, and 109%, in Benin, Nigeria, and Togo, respectively. The annual rate of increase in human population size in these countries between 1990 and 2016 varied from 3.5%-2.0% (World Bank 2019).<br/><br/><a>The 147 MW Adjarala storage hydropower project on the Mono River is now threatening the future of this species in Togodo Forest in Togo; approximately 2,315 hectares of the forest will be submerged underwater. Togolese Association for Nature Conservation (AGBO-ZEGUE) is currently making an effort to block this plan. In all areas, strict protection of remaining forest habitat and hunting restrictions are needed (G. Segniagbeto pers. comm. 2016).</a></p>","<p><em>Cercopithecus erythrogaster</em> has a scattered distribution throughout its range, but it can be locally abundant. In Nigeria, it is present in Okomu National Park and in low numbers in a number of forest reserves (e.g., Akure Ofosu, Gilli-Gilli, Ohosu, Omo, Oluwa, Idanre, Ifon, Sapoba, Taylor Creek, Udo and Taylor Creek). It is present in the Lama Forest in Benin and in the Togodo Forest in Togo, but law enforcement efforts against poaching are mostly weak (Nobime <em>et al.</em> 2011; Segniagbeto et al. 2017, 2018). Outside the protected areas and forest reserves, this species is able to persist in wetland forest where access by humans is limited (e.g., Lokoli Forest, Togbota Forest, Gnanhouizounmè Forest in Benin, and many parts of the Niger Delta), and in some seasonally inundated young forest/farm bush areas as long as hunting pressure is low (Nobimè <em>et al</em>. 2011, Oates 2011, R. Matsuda Goodwin pers. obs. 2015).<br/><br/>The rate of population decline in this species is inferred from forest loss data for 1990–2015: in Benin over this period there was a 25.4% decline of natural regenerating forest from 57,510 to 42,880 <a style="""">km²&#160;</a>(there is almost no primary forest in Benin); in Togo, there was a 78.5% decline of natural regenerating forest (there is almost no primary forest in Togo) from 6,610 to 1,420 km²; and in Nigeria, regenerating forest was reduced from 154,270 to 65,530 km² (57.5% decline), and primary forest from 15,660 to 200 km² (98.7% decline) (FAO 2015). Furthermore, there has been an accelerating rate of forest loss in Nigeria, to 5% per year in 2010–2015 (FAO 2015). In particular, between 1987 and 2011, the Niger Delta lost 38.8%, 14.6%, and 15.4% of lowland rainforest, freshwater forest, and mangrove forest, respectively (Ayanlade and Drake 2016).<br/><br/>The steep rate of population decline in the species as a whole is reflected in the data from several sites. In the Lama Forest of Benin, where there has been continuing low-grade, but constant, hunting, there has been a 55.5% reduction in the encounter rate of the red-bellied guenon (<em>C. erythrogaster erythrogaster</em>) from 0.09 group/km in 1995-1997 to 0.04 group/km in 2014-2015 (Matsuda Goodwin et al. 2017b). In Okomu National Park in Nigeria, the encounter rate of the white-throated monkey (<em>C. erythrogaster pococki</em>) declined by 26.7% between 1982 and 2010 (Oates 1985; Akinsorotan et al. 2011). Also, surveys conducted in the Niger Delta have shown continuous declines in encounter rates of primate species including <em>C. e. pococki</em> &#160;(Oates et al. 2008; Ikemeh 2009, 2015).<br/><br/>Although <em>C. erythrogaster</em> is confined to quite small, scattered forest patches in southern Benin and Togo, it occupies a much larger total area of forest in Nigeria. It is estimated that the total loss of habitat for <em>C. erythrogaster</em> has been ≥50% in the last 25 years (almost three generations), and this rate of habitat loss is expected to increase during the next decade. It is suspected that the population is declining at a similar rate (at least 50% reduction over the past 25 years, which is expected to continue into the future).</p>",Decreasing,"This species occurs in scattered populations in isolated forest patches in southwestern Nigeria and the Niger Delta, in southern Benin perhaps as far as Banon at 8°29' N (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2008), and in the Togodo Faunal Reserve and Godjin-Godjè sacred forest in Togo (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2017, 2018). In the Niger Delta, this species reaches east of the Orashi River where it has a narrow zone of hybridization and overlap with Sclater’s Guenon (<em>Cercopithecus sclateri</em>) (Oates 2011). There are two subspecies: <em>C. e. erythrogaster</em> ranges from the southwestern-most corner of Nigeria close to the Nigeria-Benin border (Matsuda Goodwin <em>et al</em>. 2017a), southern Benin including the Lama Classified Forest (Fôret Classée), Lokoli, Bonou, and Togbota Forests (Nobimè <em>et al.</em> 2011), and in the Togodo National Park and Godjin-Godjè sacred forest in eastern Togo (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2017, 2018). <em>Cercopithecus e. pococki</em> is found only in the forest zone of southwestern Nigeria and in the Niger Delta. The boundary between the two subspecies and the extent of any admixture between them is unclear, and may now be difficult to determine given intensifying agriculture and expanding urbanization in the far southwestern corner of Nigeria where their populations meet.","As larger-bodied monkeys such as the Niger Delta Red Colobus (<em>Piliocolobus epieni</em>), the White-thighed Colobus (<em>Colobus vellerosus</em>), and the Red-capped Mangabey (<em>Cercocebus torquatus</em>) are being depleted in the forests within the distribution range of this species, this small-bodied primate is now <a>increasingly hunted </a>for meat, although its secretive nature and habit of lurking in thick growth, especially in wetland habitat, provide it with some protection.

This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES and Class A of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Within the distribution range of this species, forested areas have been either converted to agricultural lands or plantations and much of the remaining forests are fragmented and degraded. Throughout its distribution range, uncontrolled hunting – nowadays hunters’ groups organize large-scale hunting parties via social media on their cell phones to go hunting for any moving animals they can hunt (R. Matsuda Goodwin pers. obs. 2018 in Nigeria). In the southwestern edge of Nigeria, larger-bodied primates like the mangabey and the white-thighed colobus have already gone locally extinct so that smaller-bodied primates are increasingly hunted for meat, although its secretive nature and the preference for liana tangles provide it with some protection (Oates 1985). To protect the species. We recommend strengthening anti-poaching law enforcement in the protected areas in all three habitat countries and also the Lama Forest be elevated to the National Park status and financial assistance be provided.<br/><br/>This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class A of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Although the species is widespread and can adapt to a variety of degraded habitats, it is still vulnerable to hunting and tropical forest coverage throughout its range and has declined significantly in recent decades. Throughout West Africa, hunters have shifted their focus to smaller-bodied primates as larger-bodied species have declined or disappeared. Encounter rates for Mona Monkeys in the Lama Forest of Benin decreased by nearly 30% from 1995 to 2015 and are expected to continue to decrease, suggesting the potential for an overall population decline of similar magnitude. This, coupled with evidence of subpopulations that have been extirpated, even in protected areas, as well as published declines in tropical forest coverage of similar magnitude in all range countries inhabited by this species, require that it be considered Near Threatened under criterion A4cd.</p>","<p>This is a lowland forest species that inhabits all but the most severely degraded habitat and extends into the savanna zone in gallery forest, and also into mangroves (Oates 2011). It is more associated with riverbanks than the closely-related&#160;<em>Cercopithecus lowei</em>&#160;on the left bank of Afram River in Ghana, where the two species are sympatric. Similarly, in Togodo National Park in Togo mixed-species associations between <em>C. mona</em> and <em>C. erythrogaster erythrogaster </em>are<em>&#160;</em>frequently seen (Segnaigebto <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the Lama Forest of Benin, 41.7% of the diet was fruit followed by 22.0% seeds, 13.6% leaves, 11.7 % flowers and 9.9% insects (Matsuda Goodwin 2007). However, in Rhoko Forest, in Nigeria, the Mona Monkey was more insectivorous (Z. Tooze pers. comm. 2014). Perhaps this dietary flexibility, which allows them to inhabit different habitats, is one reason why this species is considered an ecological generalist.</p>","<p><span style="""">This species has been impacted by large-scale habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat. However, it can adapt well to secondary habitat and human-modified forests, and remains common in parts of its range. As long as hunting pressure is not intense, this monkey can persist in degraded habitats. However, even this species, which has a high tolerance to human disturbance, has been extirpated in some localities throughout its range countries (Chapman <em>et al.</em> 2004, Matsuda Goodwin pers. obs. 2015, Nobimé pers. obs. 2015).</span></p>","<p><em>Cercopithecus mona</em> is a widespread species, common in many areas. However, even in some protected areas and forest reserves where hunting has been heavy, subpopulations of this species have declined or have been extirpated. When other, larger-bodied primate species decline significantly in number or are extirpated due to heavy hunting (the latter resulting in decreased primate species diversity), the population density of <em>C. mona</em> often increases as the result of competitive release (Linder and Oates 2011).<br/><br/>In Cameroon, this species is found in Korup National Park and several forest reserves (e.g., Douala-Edéa) (Gartlan and Struhsaker 1972). In Nigeria, it is found in a number of national parks (e.g., Gashaka-Gumti, Okomu, Old Oyo, Cross River) and forest reserves (e.g., Stubbs Creek, Edumanom, Upper Orashi in Niger Delta) (Baker and Olubode 2008, Adanu <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Togo, it is common in Fazao-Malfakassa National Park and Togodo National Park, and many other forests in the Togo highlands and along the Mono River (Segniagbeto <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Benin, this species occurs in the Lama Forest (Masuda Goodwin 2007, Nobimè <em>et al.</em> 2011); however, local extirpation of this species appears to have occurred in several forest reserves. The Mona Monkey also inhabits Digya National Park and Kalakpa National Park in Ghana.<br/><br/><span style="""">Encounter rates for this species in the Lama Forest of Benin decreased from 0.61 groups/km in  1995–1997 to 0.43 groups/km in 2014–2015 (Matsuda Goodwin, unpublished data), suggesting a population decline of close to 30% over a 20-year period (representing almost 2 generations) and is expected to continue at that rate. In  other areas, increases in this species' population  density may have occurred due to ecological release arising from the extirpation of  larger-bodied primates. For example, in Korup National Park in  Cameroon, while the yearly off-take of this species as bushmeat  increased five-fold between 1998 and 2004–2005, the sighting frequency  showed a slight increase from 0.03 groups/km to 0.04 groups/km between 1990 and 2004–2005 (Linder and Oates 2011).</span><br/><br/>Throughout the Mona Monkey's range, habitats are undergoing loss,  degradation and fragmentation.

Since the 2008 Red List assessment of Critically Endangered, there has been a significant increase in the known range and population size of <em>C. dryas</em>, with the discovery of a new population at the eastern limits of Congo’s central cuvette, as well as an additional occurrence (skin of an individual&#160;killed by a&#160;hunter) at Djombolanda village, Yahuma Territory, 36 km east of Kokolopori. Fourteen occurrences of this species are now known, seven in the Kokolopori-Wamba-Djombolanda area and seven in the Lomami-Lualaba interfluve area. At each site, the total number of groups ranges from 1 to 6, and group size ranges from 2 to 15 individuals (Kuroda <em>et al</em>. 1985, Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although the precise limits of this species' distribution are not known, it is uncommon and very localized wherever it is has been found. Average group size is ~9 individuals, with approximately 50% mature individuals in 26 groups&#160;estimated to occur across 14 known occurrences. This results in an overall population size estimate of less than 250 adults, therefore&#160;<em>C. dryas </em>qualifies as Endangered under criterion D. Further surveys are urgently needed to assess the distribution and population status of this species.</p>","<a name=""_GoBack""></a>The habitats and ecology of <em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> are not well known. It is reported to use secondary lowland moist forests of a range of ages, riparian forests and swamp forests (Kuroda <em>et al</em>. 1985, Lokasola 2014). It seems to avoid primary forest (Hurley and Lokasola 2007). The Lomami-Lualaba monkeys were observed in old secondary and riparian forests. The two southernmost locations for <em>C. dryas</em> in the Lomami National Park and adjacent buffer zone, are small riverine galleries bordered by open seasonally-inundated savannas. It is considered a highly cryptic species, hiding in thickets in dense secondary forest. <em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> are frequently found in proximity to human settlements, ranging even up to the edges of gardens&#160;in Kokolopori&#160;(Lokasola 2014). Dryas Monkeys were detected more often in secondary forest than riparian forest, with particularly high encounter rates along the edges of old gardens in Bafundo (Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> is arboreal and regularly found in the sub-canopy and lower strata of the forest. In four multi-strata camera trap surveys, 97% of Dryas Monkeys were detected in mid-to-low strata at between 2 and 10 m (Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is also found on the ground, foraging on herbaceous vegetation (Kuroda <em>et al</em>. 1985, Lokasola 2014), although Dryas Monkeys were not detected by terrestrial camera traps (Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). Dietary items include fruits, young and mature leaves, shoots, pith, seeds, insects and mushrooms (Lokasola 2014, Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> live in small social groups (most estimates are fewer than 15 individuals) with one adult male, although additional adult males have been observed in one group (Kuroda <em>et al</em>. 1985). <em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> occur in mixed-species associations, especially <em>C. ascanius</em>, which also use the lower strata in disturbed sites (S. Kuroda pers. comm. cited in Butynski 2013, Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). There are few data available on behaviour and vocalisations (Butynski 2013). No loud calls are known, though contact calls have been recorded by camera traps (Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). Adult males have a striking blue scrotum and perineal area (Alempijevic <em>et al.</em> 2018). This colourful genital region is characteristic of terrestrial forest guenons (<em>C. hamlyni</em> and <em>C. lomamiensis</em>), as well as <em>Allochrocebus</em>, <em>Chlorocebus</em> and <em>Erythrocebus</em> (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2012, Cramer <em>et al</em>. 2013). The blue patch of <em>C. dryas </em>is among the largest, relative to body size, of any <em>Cercopithecus</em>&#160;species (Kingdon 2015).","<p>Kuroda (cited in Butynski 2013) states that expanding shifting agriculture also poses a threat. However, Dryas Monkeys are thought to prefer secondary forest over undisturbed forest types.&#160;The main threat to this species is hunting, which is illegal. <em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> was documented in Wamba, Kokolopori, Djombolanda, Bafundo and Djekoshilo through hunter kills. Hurley and Lokasola (2007) and Kuroda (cited in Butynski 2013) state that the species is under pressure from poaching in Wamba and Kokolopori, and Kuroda reports declines in populations since the 1980s (Butynski 2013). In 2014, Sakamaki <em>et al</em>. (2016) confirmed that <em>C. dryas</em> occurs in the Wamba research area, however, it was not encountered during a recent primate census at the site. The Lukuru Foundation has been surveying bushmeat in the area since 2009, and the species was never reported until 2014, when one dryas kill was seen in Bafundo. Since 2014, two additional hunter-killed Dryas Monkeys have been recorded in Bafundo. However, it may be difficult to assess accurate hunting levels for such a small primate that may be eaten locally, and not traded in regional markets. Nevertheless, the impacts of even very small numbers of removals from such a small population represent a serious threat. Given that commercial bushmeat hunting occurs in most of the species’ known range, the threat is ongoing.</p>","<a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> occurs in widely-separated, isolated populations that contain small numbers of animals. It is unlikely that there is direct contact between the known eastern and western populations. At the Kokolopori-Wamba locations, Kuroda <em>et al</em>. (1985) and Hurley and Lokasola (2007) reported that group sizes typically ranged from 2-15 individuals. Butynski (2013) quotes Kuroda as recording six groups of <em>C. dryas</em>, ranging from 2-10 individuals along 1.5 km of transect in the Wamba area. At Bisandu village in the Kokolopori Bonobo Nature Reserve, Lokasola estimated that&#160;a total of 31 individuals&#160;occurred in&#160;three different groups&#160;(Yembo group: eight individuals; Bepila group: 12 individuals; Bolendela group: 11 individuals). Recent camera trap surveys in Lomami National Park suggest that two groups occur at Camp Bartho in the park interior and three groups occur in the park’s buffer zone&#160;near Bafundo village&#160;(Alempijevic <em>et al</em>. 2018). Between one and five individuals were detected by camera traps in each event. It is&#160;estimated that 26 groups occur in the 14 known occurrences, with an average group size of ~9 individuals, of which ~50% are mature individuals.

It occupies tropical evergreen and semi­-evergreen forest, tropical wet evergreen forest, tropical&#160; moist deciduous forest, coastal forest, swamp forest, low elevation pine forests (in Lao PDR and China) and montane forest, including degraded forests. In China the species occupies elevations between 50­2,000 m (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, Choudhury 2003). In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is associated with low lands, usually below 500 m.

Found in lowland primary, secondary forest, pine, dry dipterocarp, coastal swamp, montane forest. Frequently observed in riparian forests in western Thailand and Laos, occasionally near human settlements, cultivated fields where it once relatively common (back in 1990), even in highly degraded regions. Known to share associations with Assamese macaques (<em>Macaca assamemensis</em>) western Thailand and the ranges of the two species were observed to overlap in Assam. Range overlaps also with Stump-tailed and Rhesus macaques besides langurs and Hoolocks (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>This species eats more than 91 kinds of plants such as mature and tender leaves, leaf buds, leaf petioles, seeds, stems, climbers, roots, flowers, flower buds, inflorescences, bamboo shoots, and gums, insects, larvae, termite eggs and spiders. They also feed on post-harvest Rice paddy in NE India and fruits and vegetables by slash and burn agriculture of the hill tribe. Habituated groups have also been observed to beg for food and feed on biscuits as in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand.<br/><br/>In NE India, winter-spring breeding has been observed. Females are sexually receptive in August-December, but some might continue through to February. Birthing occurs in mid-January, early May, and a few in June. Swellings occur during breeding, as in Lion-tailed Macaques (<em>Macaca silenus</em>). Gestation period is 171-180 days (Choudhury 2008).<br/><br/>This species is primarily arboreal, but it may use both terrestrial and arboreal pathways; individuals flee from danger through trees and not by ground. They use the ground when crossing clearings, roads, to forage, feed in degraded areas and also feed on crops. Seasonal fluctuations dictate the time spent on the ground feeding on crops. One site reported macaques spending over 20% of their time feeding on the ground on sugar cane left overs by elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). Detailed observation of the species in eastern and central Assam in 1992-1994 and 2004 recorded three peaks of feeding and long mid-day rest, shorter mid-morning rest spells, resting 45%, feeding 23.5%, locomotion 17-19.4%, grooming 6-8%. Actual time spent feeding 153-229 mins/day. Spent 65% of feeding time in January on harvested paddy.<br/><br/>In Assam (Tikleswari, Borajan) the macaques raids the vegetable gardens, crop field and villages (Chetry and Das pers. comm).<br/><br/>Home range is 83-347 ha, with about 25-48% overlap (Choudhury 2008). Daily movement is 690-2,240 m, influenced by weather and availability of fruits: where fruiting trees were far apart, the daily movement increased. Multi-male, multi-female groups of 12-40 individuals are seen (Choudhury 2008). Estimated group size in Laos rarely exceeds 20-30 individuals. There are few records of groups numbering 50-150 individuals in KhaoYai National Park in Thailand, DakLak Province in Viet Nam and DhouPhouVieng National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos. It may be the case that two or more groups were feeding together.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km2 as studied in 21 sites.&#160; They spent only about 1% of their time on the ground and about 85% of their time on mid canopy and in 97.6% of the cases found inside the forest as opposed to the sympatric <em>M. mulatta </em>that is found outside forests in farms and gardens. Direct competition was found to be scarce between the species and the overlap or sharing of resources was only found to be 22.4%. Of the 101 plant species used between both the species, only 42.6%&#160; shared (Feroz, 2012).<br/><br/>In KhaoYai National Park,Thailand these macaques preferred tall sleeping trees (mean 20.9+/- SD 4.9 m) and ‘high sleeping places’(15.8+/- SD 4.3 m) and tend to reuse the sleeping site, an anti-predator strategy (Albert <em>et al</em>. 2011).","Habitat disturbances affecting the future survival of this species include: selective logging; timber and firewood collection for making charcoal; building roads, dams, power lines; and deliberately setting fires. These threats lead to&#160; forest fragmentation and soil loss/erosion. Specifically, a decrease in habitat quality has been due to the loss of fruiting trees and sleeping sites through monocultures and plantations, selective felling, and a subsequent increase in canopy gaps. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Habitat loss and poaching are the major threats in India and Bangladesh. There has been a reduction in forest in Assam by over 10% in two years between 2001 and 2003 (Forest Survey of&#160; India 2003) and the rate of habitat loss has not reduced. Recent forest cover survey report of Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Government of India suggest that the dense forest cover in the distribution range is decreasing 2011-2013.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting for food and trade is the primary threat, but as a predominantly lowland species habitat&#160; loss likely is also a major threat to the&#160; species. In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. Sometimes, a well-trained macaque is sold for 1,000 USD. They are also in demand by resorts for show (R. Boonratana pers. comm). <br/><br/>In Myanmar, hunting, trade, habitat loss in varying degrees, shifting cultivation in the north, logging in the east and south, and rubber plantations are the major threats (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>In China, hunting, habitat loss and disturbance are major threats. There is a perceptible change in habitat quality that has an impact on the species (Huang <em>et al</em>. pers. comm).","In China, the species’ population is estimated to be less than 1,700 individuals (Jiang and Long pers. comm). No information is available on the status of the population dynamics, but it is suspected to be in decline. A very small population occurs in Bangladesh, which is isolated from the neighbouring Indian locations. This habitat is degrading rapidly, thereby causing a continuing decline in mature individuals in the country (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>A group density of 0.07 individuals/km² was recorded in Namdapha National Park, India, by Chetry <em>et al</em>.

In India the population is &lt;1,500 individuals and populations are declining rapidly (Chetry and Das pers. comm.) but in one protected area (Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary) it is increasing. Choudhury (2003) stated that there may have been around 24,000 of these macaques in India at the turn of this century. The population has apparently declined owing to habitat loss.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km² as studied in 21 sites. The mean of seven groups in Assam was 23.3 (range: 16-33) (Choudhury 2008); however, the largest group observed was of 43 macaques in Radhakishorepur reserved forest, Tripura in 2016 (Choudhury 2017).<br/><br/>It is also declining steadily in Myanmar.&#160; The animals are very patchily distributed in Myanmar. <br/><br/>The species is widely distributed and common in large forest blocks remaining in southern and central Lao PDR, but it is much scarcer in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam (R. Timmins pers. comm). It is widely distributed through the remaining forest areas of Cambodia. Populations are stable in Thailand. <br/><br/>Declines are due to different threats in different countries. There have been declines of more than 30% in the last 30­-35 (three generations) years in India, Bangladesh, China, Viet Nam and Myanmar. There are perceptible declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia, but the rates are close to or lower than 30%. In most of the countries, the species is predicted to decline at a rate higher than 30% over the next three generations due to increasing trends in habitat loss, persecution, and trade.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in eastern Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China (southwestern Yunnan), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura (Choudhury 1988, 2013)), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand (from about 8°N and including adjacent islands), and central and southern Viet Nam. There might be a gap in the distribution in central and northeastern Myanmar between about 20 and 25°N, where it has not been recorded except on the coast at Arakan. In India found north to the Brahmaputra River (Groves 2001).<br/><br/>Records from Xizang (China) are probably misidentified rhesus macaques (MacKinnon in press).  It has recently been recorded from Namdapha National Park in northeastern India (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>The precise taxonomic boundary between <em>M. leonina</em> and <em>M. nemestrina</em> is not well defined. There are populations of the two taxa found on either side of the distribution limits in the Isthmus of Kra, but many of these populations are the result of release by humans. The two species hybridize in a small area of southern peninsular Thailand, as well as on the islands of Phuket and Yao Yai (Groves 2001).  <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, there are historical records from as far north as Nghe An province, but there is uncertainty whether the species was ever found north of this province.

In Cambodia, the species is reported only in five out of 24 provinces: use in traditional medicine, loss of habitat from logging, and trade are major threats in the region. In Myanmar, logging, plantation, aquaculture, hunting for food and pets, political unrest in cultural minority states impact primates. Timber extraction, large scale farms and plantations, irrigation, hydroelectric projects, highway construction, mineral exploration, resettlement programs for hill tribes, recreation and tourism, have significantly reduced forest cover in Thailand. Shifting cultivation of hill tribes and ethnic Thais have cleared large forests.

It prefers dense evergreen forests (Choudhury 2001). Srivastava and Mohnot (2001) report it from lowland semi­evergreen forests to monsoon and montane forests. In India, it occurs at elevations of 50­2-700m (Molur <em>et </em><em>al</em>. 2003; Choudhury 2001, 2002; Srivastava and Mohnot 2001), between 200 and 2,200 m in Myanmar (Htun pers. comm.), and up to 2,400 m in China (X. Jiang pers. comm.); in Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia it is predominantly found above 400 m, while in karst limestone environments it is found in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is considered arboreal as well as terrestrial, and is diurnal. It feeds primarily on seeds and fruits. It has a generation time of 10­-12 years (Molur <em>et </em><em>al</em>. 2003). It eats fruit, insects, small vertebrates, and immature leaves, and will also raid crops for potatoes and rice. It occurs widely in the hill and mountain areas of VietNam, Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). In Thailand it is widespread but discontinuous, in forests associated with limestone, and other forest habitats (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). In China it is found in broadleaved evergreen forests, and sometimes in secondary forests close to farmlands (X. Jiang pers. comm).<br/><br/>Long-term study in India reported that the species consume highest 23.65% of time on feeding of seeds, 21.81% in fruits, 14.22% in leaves and twigs, 10.35% in root and tubers. Moreover, they spent 8.09% in bamboo shoots and 7.79% in feeding other minor food items&#160; (Chetry and Chetry 2015).<br/><br/>Stump-tailed Macaque is very selective over the lodging trees it chooses; in India it has been found to use only six species of tree for lodging (Chetry and<strong>&#160;</strong>Bhattacharjee 2004).<br/><br/>The species is also found in lower altitudes; a young individual was captured in Cachar, Assam from 60 m asl. The elevation of Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary is just above 100 m. &#160;Climate varies from tropical to subtropical across the macaques in distribution.

These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine,” and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>In India much of its habitat is affected by Jhum cultivation (shifting or slash­and­burn) (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). It has also been indiscriminately hunted over almost its entire distribution in India (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). The vulnerability of being hunted is due to large body size and terrestrial in habit (Chetry and Das pers.com)<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is heavily targeted for use in traditional “medicine,” both in country and for trade with China. Agriculture, hydropower and mining developments are the other threats that need to be watched.<br/><br/>Within Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting levels for food is also very high. Habitat loss is a relatively lower threat compared to hunting (R. Timmins pers. comm).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, where Stump-tailed Macaques are found only in three of 24 sites, are yet threatened by concession mining, and land mining are existing threats even in protected areas.<br/><br/>In Laos, the species suffers from opportunistic hunting in their area of occurrence across the country for supply of bones for 'medicinal' use in Vietnam is threatening the population. Logging, gold mining and shifting cultivation are accounted as some direct threats. Other threats include extensive poaching and earlier were used in manufacturing polio medicine. Poaching for traditional medicine is still on unabated and therefore pressing the remaining population. Absence of any new conservation measure is in not helping the situation either.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, logging and timber extraction are major threats. Commercial rubber plantations, hunting, and trade of animals parts with China are all major threats to this species. In China, hunting and habitat loss have reduced in population of this species, and it is locally extinct in some places. Over hunting might have extirpated the population in Guangdong Province. Habitat loss from plundering of evergreen broad leaf forest is a serious threat. In Thailand, habitat loss is a major threat, while hunting is prevalent, but not a significant threat to the species (R. Boonratana pers. comm). Until 1976, until the ban on international trade in 1976 of primates, trade and export of Stump-tailed Macaque was well and active. The United States of America alone imported <em>ca</em> 30,000 primates from Thailand, mostly macaques, for use in biomedical research and some were famously sold as ‘miniature chimpanzees’. The population in peninsular Thailand was thus significantly reduced due to this trapping for trade and export. Large scale farming, plantations, marine product use resulting in habitat loss and habitat degradation has also affected the population.</p>","<p>Populations in South Asia and in Myanmar are few and fragmented (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003; S.Htun pers. comm.).

In mainland Southeast Asia, such as in Cambodia and Viet Nam, females are taken into breeding facilities and males are exported internationally primarily for use in laboratory research. A potential related issue is the release of confiscated long-tailed macaques from the border area of Viet Nam and China (which is where most of the current international trade is being recorded) into the native range of other macaque species. In the Philippines, the species is subject to a high level of hunting, where it is taken for local consumption and hunted for sport. It is also persecuted as a pest.

The population in 1980 was estimated at 39,000 (WWF 1980); it was estimated at 17,000-30,000 <em>ca</em> 25 years later (Whittaker 2006). In 2015, the subpopulation within Siberut<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">s only protected area (Siberut National Park, covering &gt;40% of the island), was estimated to number just over 9,000 individuals (Quinten<em> et al</em>. 2015). <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""></span></span></p>","<p><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">Siberut macaques are semi-terrestrial and have been observed to live in almost all the forest types existing on Siberut (annual rainfall: <em>ca</em> 4,000 mm)—in both primary and disturbed areas—including dipterocarp-, mixed-, swamp- and mangrove forests as well as nipa palm groves (Whitten and Whitten 1982, Fuentes 2002); according to Wilson and Wilson (1976) they prefer primary riverine coastal swamp forest.<br/><br/>They occur in larger groups (up to 29 individuals are reported; Richter 2013) which often split up into smaller <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">“<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">foraging units<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">” <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">during the day (Fuentes 2002). These groups can consist of multiple adult males together with multiple adult females and their offspring (Richter 2013).<br/><br/>While an early study estimated the species<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’ <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">home range to encompass over 500 ha (Whitten and Whitten 1982), more recent data suggests smaller ranges of around 135 ha (Richter 2013/14). The same study reports a monthly average travel distance of the studied group of 2048.4 m and a travel speed of 169.6 m/h; these macaques spent 57.3 % of their time travelling, 14.6 % resting, 12.1 % foraging, 10.1 % feeding, and 5.9 % involved in social activities (Richter 2013).<br/><br/>With over 75% of their diet consisting of fruit, the species is primarily frugivorous (Richter 2013). However, it also consumes a number of other food items, like arthropod material (e.g., ants, spiders, termite eggs, larvae), mushrooms, leaves, the petioles of palm seedlings and also crabs as well as crayfish (Whitten and Whitten 1982, Richter 2013). Pith, sap, shoots and flowers are also eaten, but form a very small portion of the diet (&lt;4%).<br/><br/>Siberut macaques commonly sleep in tall trees near secondary-ridge tops (e.g., Dipterocarpus), and they are known to vocalise frequently, especially in the early morning hours <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">– <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">a behaviour that is assumed to support group cohesion (Whitten and Whitten 1982, Fuentes 2002). The species is considered <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">‘<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">ecologically most similar<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’ <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">to <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""><em>Macaca nemestrina</em><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""> (Richter2014).<span lang=""DE""> <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">Other sympatric primates include <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""><em>Presbytis siberu, Simias concolor, </em><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">and<em> Hylobates klossii.</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">While eagles and potentially pythons have been suggested as natural predators of this monkey (Whitten and Whitten 1982), it is beyond doubt that today humans are the biggest danger: The species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging, as well as by conversion of forests into oil palm plantations, forest clearing and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). Despite Siberut macaques not being the preferred food of the indigenous people (the meat is considered unpalatable), hunting pressure has increased in recent years. This is primarily the result of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Furthermore, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been progressively eroded due to missionary and state influences (Whittaker 2006; Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). Interview surveys in 50 villages on Siberut revealed that 24% of the respondents were <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">‘<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">active hunters<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’ <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">and 71% of those respondents target <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""><em>Macaca siberu</em><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">. The average number hunted per three months was two per hunter, leading to off-take estimates of 1,549<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">–<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">3,098 per year or between 5 and 18% of the total population (Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014).</span></span></span></span><br/><br/>Although the pet trade is also considered a threat (Whittaker 2006), Quinten <em>et al.</em> (2014) report that only 1 out of 390 interviewees in their study specifically indicated the use of primates as pets, so this is probably not a significant driver of the population decline.<br/><br/>Macaque groups are known to venture into the <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">‘<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">forest gardens<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’ <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">and coconut groves that surround the human settlements in search of food (Fuentes 2002); the species is therefore considered a pest and consequently killed (Whittaker 2006); sometimes sago traps are used, where hunters trap a whole group of macaques at once. Selective logging of the large trees which they need for daily sustenance might increase crop raiding behaviour and thus exacerbate the conflict with human communities (Richter 2014).<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""></span></span></span></p>","<p><span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">Whittaker (2006) estimated the total macaque population on Siberut to comprise between 17,000-30,000 individuals. A more recent estimate, albeit only for Siberut National Park (&gt;40 % of the island), puts the park’<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">s<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""> Siberut Macaque population at 9,248 (4,639<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">–<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">18,438) individuals (Quinten<em> et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/>Density estimates for this species vary considerably, probably as a result of the different ecologies / pressures within the respective areas that were surveyed in the past: In relatively undisturbed peat swamp forest, the species occurs at densities of 35.8 (25.5<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">–<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">50.4) individuals/km<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">² <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">(Quinten <em>et al.</em> 2010), while densities in adjacent lowland rainforest on mineral soil were only 16.2 (9.4<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">–<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">27.9) individuals/km<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">² <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">(both in the informally protected Peleonan Forest, North Siberut; Waltert <em>et al</em>. 2008). Densities are even lower within the more heterogeneous habitat of Siberut National Park: 5.6 (2.8<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">–11) individuals/km²<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""> (Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2015).

It occurs in only one protected area, Siberut National Park.</span><br/><br/>Whittaker (2006) suggests the following conservation actions: ""1) increased protection for Siberut National Park, which currently lacks enforcement, 2) formal protection of the Peleonan Forest in North Siberut, which is home to unusually high primate populations and is easily accessible, 3) conservation education, especially regarding hunting, and 4) the development of alternative economic models for the local people to reduce the likelihood of selling off their lands to logging companies.""<br/><br/>Quinten <em>et al</em>. (2014) further suggest<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""> “<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">(i) lobbying the local government to ban the use and possession of air rifles throughout the archipelago, and confiscate such weapons; (ii) an island-wide campaign to emphasize cultural tradition in order to increase the hunters<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">’ <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">inclination to follow traditional practices and<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""> <span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">taboos, including ceremonial rather than opportunistic hunting; (iii) improving agricultural practices to decrease dependence on primates for animal protein; (iv) active inclusion of locals into conservation projects and environmental tourism ventures on Siberut as guides and field assistants who can act as multipliers for a positive conservation message in their communities.<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc"">”</span></span></span><br/><br/>Considering that—despite good habitat quality—the population density of macaques in the National Park appears to be ca. three times lower compared to the (informally protected) Peleonan Forest, Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2015 provide several park-specific conservation actions to improve the area’s status as a conservation stronghold:&#160; A) They advise the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry to increase funding for the Park, to ensure adequate human resources to support the enforcement of its statutes on a local level and to improve staff training in conservation management. B) They also suggest to place greater emphasis on outreach activities to foster successful interaction and cooperation between Park management and the resident communities, raising local awareness of the value of Siberut’s rainforest habitat and the importance of a sustainable approach to resource utilization. C) They recommend that further research be carried out, specifically time-series land-cover assessments to determine rates of deforestation/habitat loss, and long-term monitoring of population trends inside and outside the Park (in Siberut’s production forest/timber concessions).<span class=""nlmpublisher-loc""></span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

17949995,39794,Macaca pagensis,Critically Endangered,A2acd+4acd,2020,2015-11-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is considered Critically Endangered due to past population decline, estimated at more that 80% over the past 39 years (three generations) and continuing decline due to hunting and loss of habitat. Due to the ongoing nature of the threats, it is predicted to decline by the same rate over at least the next 13 years; it is suspected that the species will undergo a reduction of &gt;80% over the three-generation period 2001-2040.</p>","<p>This species is found in both primary and disturbed areas (Whitten and Whitten 1982; Fuentes 1996/1997), preferring primary riverine coastal swamp forest (Wilson and Wilson 1976). Coconut groves near villages.<br/><br/>It is primarily frugivorous (Whitten and Whitten 1982). Primarily frugivores. Diurnal. Terrestrial and arboreal. They are known to feed on coconuts but only adult males can crack open coconuts. They vocalize early morning.<br/><br/>Spend most time at the lower levels of forest and on the ground. Group size of 5-25 individuals and the largest group observed had two adult males. Groups typically split into smaller groups during the day but through coconut groves and primary forest they move as one large groups. Home range unknown. They interact with two colobine species of the island <em>Presbytis potenziani </em>(Mentawai langurs)<em> </em>and <em>Simias concolor </em>(Pig-tailed Langur).</p>","<p>This species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006), as well as by conversion to oil palm plantations and forest clearing and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). The hunting and logging is seen to increase with the burgeoning human population. Only 10-15% of the original forest cover remains on Sipora (Fuentes 1996/1997). Recently, hunting pressure has increased because of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 calibre air rifles (anything larger is illegal in Indonesia) (Whittaker 2006). They are often trapped and killed as crop pests. The Pagai macaque meat though is considered unpalatable but are one of the easiest to catch as they fall for traps. Often cages are used so entire troops are captured in one trap. The ground-living macaques are also affected by road construction where the habitat and territories are affected.<br/><br/>Also, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been replaced by Christianity (Whittaker 2006). The pet trade is also a threat to this species (Whittaker 2006). Though this species is not a preferred food item, it is still hunted and poisoned as it is considered a crop pest (Whittaker 2006). While habitat disturbance appears to positively affect population densities, it is found in lower densities near human settlements (Whittaker 2006).</p>","<p>All populations of this species are urgently in need of protective measures (Whittaker 2006). The estimates of density for it suggest 7-12 individuals/km² in suitable habitat in the Pagai Islands (Paciulli 2004), giving a total of about 2,100 to 3,700 individuals (down from 15,000 in 1980) (Whittaker 2006). This species lives at much higher densities in logged forest than in unlogged forest, and their highest density is in forest logged 20 years ago (Whittaker 2006). Surveys carried out in 2011 suggest the number of animals has decreased since 2004 to about &lt;2,500 individuals mainly due to hunting. <br/><br/>Highest densities of Pagai macaque found in logged forest that in unlogged forest. Most abundant species to be found during line transects in Pagai Islands. </p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs exclusively on the southern Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia (Pagai Selatan (South Pagai), Pagai Utara (North Pagai), and Sipora) (Roos <em>et al. </em>2003) and on the Sinakek off the east coast of South Pagai.</p><p><u></u></p>","Although the meat is unpalatable, the species is hunted rampantly for consumption. Also caught for the pet trade.",Terrestrial,"<p>The species does not occur in any protected areas. Whittaker (2006) suggests the following conservation actions: protection of areas in the Pagai Islands by cooperating with a logging corporation that has practised sustainable logging techniques there since 1971; conservation education, especially regarding hunting; and the development of alternative economic models for the local people, to reduce the likelihood of selling off their lands to logging companies. It is listed on CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/>Not found in any protected area but found in areas suggested for protection (including Betumonga Research Area and the Sinakak Islet) both reportedly logged in recent years. No viable captive population. Only 10-15% of original forest remain in Sipora.       </p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
17950189,12549,Macaca assamensis,Near Threatened,A2cd,2020,2015-11-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Assam Macaque is listed as Near Threatened as it is experiencing declines due to hunting and habitat degradation and fragmentation. These declines are significant, but probably are not yet enough to qualify for listing as Vulnerable (i.e., 30% over three generations or 36 years). If the threats continue or increase in the future, the species will have to be reassessed and it may then move into a threatened category.</p>","<p>This species is diurnal and omnivorous, and at times both arboreal and terrestrial. It prefers dense forest (Choudhury 2001), and does not usually occur in secondary forest. It is found in tropical and subtropical semi­evergreen forests, dry deciduous and montane Forest (Srivistava and Mohnot 2001, R. Boonratana pers. comm.). Particular habitats and niches vary some depending on the subspecies. This species is found from the floodplains to the high mountains, up to 2,800 m, and sometimes 3,000 m in the summer (Choudhury 2001), and perhaps up to 4,000 m (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001, Zhang <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2002). It is generally an upland species, and usually associated with hill areas above 1,000 m. In the wetter east the species may also frequent areas that do not or only marginally reach 1,000m and may occur even in the lowlands. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is predominantly associated with high altitudes, usually above 500 m. In forests on limestone karst the species occurs in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). Six sites at 200-400 m asl range in Karst habitats were reported from Lao PDR: Houay Phasong, Nam Ngo, and 4 sites in Muang Vilabouli (Timmins and Duckworth 2013)</p>  <p>The generation of this species is 10­-12 years (Molur <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2003). There is a wide preference of vegetation across the macaque distribution. From subtropical mid-elevation montane broadleaf rainforests and temperate evergreen forests of higher elevations. In Thailand, they occupy mixed deciduous/bamboo dry evergreen forest from lowland to mountainous areas. Rocky crags and karsts are also preferred sleeping sites. They are also found close to human settlements where they are provisioned and in many areas like Kanchanaburi Province (14°41’N), Thailand they have resorted to begging. </p>  <p>There is a gradual change in preference for food in certain areas of their distribution such as in Darjeeling, West Bengal of which eleven of their 63 preferred plant species are cultigens. Generally, their natural diet includes fruits such as banana, mango, papaya, apple, litchi, cucumber, papaya, orange, bamboo shoots, and leaves. They are also used to feeding of human hands and prefer food such as bread, other varieties of cooked snacks, molasses. </p>  <p>In Assam the species raid the vegetable gardens, crop land and villages near to their habitats (Chetry and Das pers. comm.).</p>  <p>Dietary studies in Nonggang, China, conducted between 2005 and 2006 suggest folivorous inclination: 77.4% of all feeding records were of leaves and 17.4% of total feeding records were of fruits. Young leaves formed the ‘bulk’ of the diet with their consumption ration varying from 44.9% in July to 92.9% in May. <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calicolus</em>, a type of bamboo and its unexpanded leaves formed the bulk of the young leaf diet (Zhou <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2011)</p>  <p>Follow-up studies conducted in Nonggang between 2012 and 2013 corroborate the finding. While leaves were dominant in the diet (75.5%), the leaves of&#160; <em>Bonia</em><em> </em><em>saxatilis</em> bamboo were more preferred as opposed to <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calicolus</em>. Seventy-eight food species were reported to be consumed by the macaques in the region (Huang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) </p>  <p>Modest swelling of sexual skin during breeding. Gestation of 5.5 months and single young born every two years. There is seasonal migration to higher altitudes in summer and to lower altitudes in winter. Multimale-multifemale type social organization. Schulke <em>et al.</em> (2010) derived the relationship between social bonds and reproductive success in wild macaques in Thailand. Tight social bonds in male macaques was seen to promote good ‘coalition’ which in turn translated into social dominance and reproductive success. Female Assamese macaques tend to exhibit ‘non-random’ and ‘promiscuous’ mating across male ranks and mate more frequently with certain males while exhibiting ‘concealed’ fertility. This tactic could in fact protect infants during intra-troop change in male dominance and as suggested in the literature, to main special and particular bonds in a rather open and ‘promiscuous’ environment (Furtbauer <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2014)</p>  <p>Average group size of 20 individuals. Group size in Nonggang 15-17 individuals. Single males outside group have been spotted.</p>  <p>Home range of 53-65 ha and mean daily path length of 590-782 m as studied in Nonggang Food distribution seems to influence the macaques distribution wherein most of their time was seen to be spent on cliffs (71.7% of total location records) and hillsides (20.2%). The cliffs and hill tops are often inundated with <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calcicolus</em>, the primary preferred leaf source of macaques (Zhou <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;2014).</p>  <p>Parasite prevalence rate in Assamese macaques in Shivpuri Nagarjuna National Park was 72.94%. Protozoan and helminth parasites were found during faecal studies in the macaques suggesting such parasites as conservation threats to the species (Pokhrel and Maharajan 2014). </p>","The threats to this species' habitat include selective logging and various forms of anthropogenic development and activities, alien invasive species, and hunting and trapping for sport,“medicine,” food, and the pet trade. Additionally, hybridization with adjacent species poses a threat to some populations (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although it has a wide distribution, the species is considered to be threatened in most parts of its range. Habitat destruction is the primary cause of the decline. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses the greatest risk to this species in northeastern India (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). However, it has been hunted in the Himalayan regions of North Bengal, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, where it frequently invades crops (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). Locals use skulls as an “evil eye” in front of houses in northeastern India (Das pers. comm.). There has been extensive habitat loss over the last 15 years in several states of northeastern India (from 30 to 60%), with major impacts on <em>M. a. assamensis</em>. <br/><br/>The Nepal population of <em>Macaca assamensis </em>is threatened due to its restricted distribution of less than 2,200 km² extent of occurrence and 914 km area of occupancy and continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, the number of locations and in the number of mature individuals the latter two conditions being inferred from threats to habitat and population from degradation and hunting, respectively. Given its restricted extent of occurrence, threats on its population and habitat, and small numbers in fragmented patches, the Nepal population of this macaque is categorized as Endangered.<br/><br/>In Thailand habitat loss is the primary threat, hunting for food less so (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). It is protected only in temples.<br/><br/>In eastern Myanmar habitat loss is the primary threat, but hunting is presumed to occur. They are hunted to make footwear, and the skins are taken to Tibet as it is more profitable than taking it to Yunnan province of China. In northern Myanmar, hunting and habitat loss due to conversion are the major threats. There is more than 30% decline in forest cover over the last 30-­35 years. The combination of habitat loss and hunting heavily impacts the subpopulations, and the threats are likely to continue in the next three decades if the demand for this continues in Tibet (S. Htun pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the primary threat is hunting for food and for bones to make balm and/or glue. The bones are not used within Lao PDR, but sold to Viet Namese and traders within Lao PDR. The balm is used for pain relief and other speculative “medicinal” purposes. The trade also goes into China (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). This species has declined in VietNam and Lao PDR in the last 30-35 years by more than 30%, and is expected to continue to decline in the future.<br/><br/>In Tibet the habitat is good, but there is some hunting, and no detailed data exists for <em>M. a. pelops</em> from that region of China (Z. Zhou et al. pers. comm.). For <em>M. a. assamensis</em>, Hunting is a major threat. Logging has ceased, but was a major threat for the last 30 years. Conversion to pastures is still ongoing, but not a significant threat There are extensive habitats still left for this subspecies and the taxon is relatively safe. <br/><br/>Habitat reduction and degradation, agricultural activities, mining, rapid developmental activities in certain areas of the macaque’s distribution, hunting for food, traditional medicine, selective logging, loss of fruiting trees and human encroachment into critical macaque habitat, gold mining and shifting cultivation in Viet Nam, limestone mining destroying the macaques preferred habitats. Poaching for food and hunting for sale, political unrest in Myanmar are some existing serious threats.","There is little information available on the global population. Although it is thought to be relatively high, there is decline in the wild populations in certain countries, but not throughout the distribution. It is probably the most common macaque species in Lao PDR, where it is widespread through hill and mountain forest ranges, though no population estimate is available (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, R. Timmins pers. comm). In Nepal the taxon is also restricted to less than 300 mature individuals, distributed in eight subpopulations, with no subpopulation having more than 50 mature individuals. There is no information on population estimates from Thailand (R. Boonratana pers. comm). In northern Myanmar it is a very common species, but information from the eastern part of the country is not available (S. Htun pers. comm). <br/><br/>Due to hunting pressure, macaques in Viet Nam are scarce. However, there is no precise information for this species on population and status (R. Timmins pers. comm). The subspecies <em>M. a. assamensis </em>is relatively widespread in its extent of occurrence (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh, India, the population was found to have a group density of 1.11/km and an average group size of 13.93 individuals (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). This species is the most abundant monkey in the mountains of Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2001). In China 8,200 individuals is reported in 2009 (Long and Jiang pers. comm). The subspecies <em>M. a. pelops</em> is only found in adjacent populations in India, Bhutan, and adjacent China. There are likely fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2002). A subpopulation of <em>M. assamensis </em>is endemic to Nepal and relegated to a single population there, and is considered as a possible new subspecies (M. Chalise pers. comm.). However, further taxonomic clarification is needed.<br/><br/>No new population estimate in any of the macaque’s distribution. The macaques though have seen remarkable decline in population over the years and still under threat (refer to threats section) from numerous unsustainable activities.<br/><br/>In China, in the 1950s and 1960s the macaques are believed to be quite numerous and very much common in south-eastern Yunnan and in Gunagxi until they became really rare due to the threat of hunting and trapping for traditional medicine.",Decreasing,"<em>Macaca assamensis</em> occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, southwestern China (Guangxi, Guizhou, Tibet and Yunnan), northwestern India (Uttarakhand), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, and West Bengal), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, northwestern Thailand, and northern Viet Nam. It is found from western Nepal east into northern Myanmar and southeast through southernmost China to the upper Mekong in Tibet, and in the east into southern Guizhou to Hoi Xuan in Viet Nam and Thateng in Lao PDR; the range continues south through the Myanmar/Thailand border ranges as far as Chongkrong, as well as to the Sunderbans in Bangladesh. <br/><br/>There is a gap in northeastern India between the two main population pockets, specifically between central Bhutan and the south side of the Brahmaputra; the east bank of its upper course, the Dibang, marks the division between the two subspecies (Groves 2001). More recent studies indicate no gap in the population as the species is found throughout Arunachal Pradesh state, and the Sunderban population requires careful consideration given that only two individuals have been seen in over 140 years with no recent updates on the social media or anywhere on the distribution of the species (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/><em>Macaca a. assamensis</em> occurs in South and South-east Asia, from 200 to 2,750 m asl, east of Brahmaputra, southwestern China (Southeastern Xizang Autonomous Region Tibet, west and south of Yunnan, south Guizhou, southwestern Guanxi provinces), northeastern India (Eastern Arunachal Pradesh, eastern Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura states, south and east through northern, eastern and western Myanmar, northern and western Thailand, Laos and northern Viet Nam.<br/><br/><em>Macaca a. pelops</em> occurs up to 3,100 m in the Himalaya from central Nepal (western limit being Tipling 83°36’ E) through to northeastern India (northern West Bengal, Sikkim, western Assam states, and Bhutan (eastern limit Manas River, 90°58’E) widely ‘disjunct’ and ‘geographic relict’ in Sunderbans, southwestern Bangladesh.","It is hunted for food, 'medicine' and for fashion apparel.",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed in Appendix II of CITES (Chetry <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2003).

17950602,12555,Macaca nemestrina,Endangered,A4acd,2020,2015-11-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Maraca nemestrina</em> inhabits the same forests as gibbons and siamangs, both of which are highly threatened. Sunda Pig-tailed Macaque is assessed as Endangered based on an estimated population reduction of more than 50% when considering the past 20 years and projected future habitat change due to draining of peat swamps, logging and burning into the next 15 years (totalling 30-36 years which is approximately three generations). Where the species persists there is hunting and collection for the wildlife trade and for human consumption.<strong></strong></p>","<p>This is a predominantly terrestrial animal, although it readily climbs and forages in the forest canopy. It is diurnal and frugivorous. It occupies lowland primary and secondary forest, as well as coastal, swamp and montane forest. It prefers dense rainforest at all elevations, but is equally at home in agricultural land. <br/><br/>High densities of these macaques are usually found in lowland and hill dipterocarp rainforests. Although they are known to occur from sea level to 1,900 m, they still prefer higher elevations and dry grounds on the foot of the hills and slopes (Bersacola <em>et al</em>. in prep). They are found in lowland and swamp forest of peninsular Malaysia. Though no regular residents of the swamp, the macaques visit lowland swamps, especially during months of lowest rainfall, i.e. during flowering and fruiting. Frequently found around agricultural fields, hill side farms, fringes of urban environments. Seen in association with Long Tailed Macaques (<em>M. fascicularis</em>) in lowland primary and secondary forest including peat-swamp forest as well as degraded habitats. This species has been reported in oil palm plantations, both near the edge and further in.<br/><br/>Mainly frugivores and include leaves and invertebrates in their diet. An 18-month study in peninsular Malaysia revealed the diet including fruits (74.2%), leaves and buds (11.1%), flowers (1.1%), invertebrates (12.2%) and other items (1.4%). Swarming termites, grasshoppers, other insects, spiders, fruits, seeds, young leaves, leaf stems, and fungi were consumed elsewhere in the same region. They are known to eat figs (<em>Ficus </em>(Moracea)), other fruits, leaves, and miscellaneous food items in northern Sumatra. Known to feed on crops oil palm fruit, mature corn ears, thick and spiny skinned durian fruit, tapioca roots. They are also known to raid papaya as it can be easily transported to the edge of the forest for easier and quick consumption. They are known to raid farms until a favourite crop such as corn is completely consumed and the field completely destroyed.<br/><br/>Keep to the ground and even use the ground to flee. They are also known to feed off the ground but ‘more often’ on trees. They are known to spend more time moving than feeding (5.6%) or foraging and sitting (11.1%). While the latter is the case in Sumatra, in eastern Kalimantan travelling and foraging on the ground accounted for 67% of contacts. In Peninsular Malaysia, an adjusted daily activity budget of locomotion (61%), resting (19%) and foraging (16%), social behaviour (4%) were recorded during an 18-month study. Their low vocalizations are audible at distances of 30-80 m. The males might vocalize when approaching trees at dusk.<br/><br/>Home range of 100-300 h, parts of which used infrequently. Daily movements 600 m in north Sumatra. They live in multi-male multi female groups. Adult male-female sex ratio 1:8 in 13 groups of 15-55 individuals (average of 24) to 1:2.7 (including adult and sub-adult mature males) in three groups of 49-81 individuals. Circumanal swellings are evident during the breeding. Breeding happens through the year. Gestation averages 172 days.<br/><br/>Average group size 10.5 individuals (range 1-20) in hill dipterocarp forest, seven individuals (range 6-8) in montane forest, 9.5 individuals in sub-montane forest and 8.5 individuals (range 1-13) in lowland forest.<br/><br/>The macaques were found to select tall trees (20.9+/-SD 4.9 m) and ‘high sleeping places’ of (15.8+/-SD 4.3 m), a supposed anti-predator strategy. They are also known to prefer sleeping trees close to their last feeding site, another anti-predator strategy which would mimimise the risk of being exposed to predators in travelling to sleeping sites (Albert <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>These animals are threatened by loss of habitat, which is very serious in many parts of its range. There is extensive loss of lowland forest in Malaysia and Indonesia to expanding oil palm plantations, as well as to logging and agricultural expansion. This species is also frequently shot as a crop pest (M. Richardson pers. comm.) and hunted for food.<br/><br/>Fragmentation due to human encroachments, habitat loss from legal and illegal logging, traditional modern monoculture crop plantation such as oil palm, land clearance for agriculture,&#160; and new settlements/transmigration, forest fires and drought (as have occurred in Kalimantan), hunting for illegal pet trade. Lowland forests are the most seriously threatened. Tropical forests of Lowlands are now occupied by commercial timber concession, cultivated lands, human settlements. The spread of oil palm is the greatest threat, both in Indonesia and Malaysia. From 1967 to 2000, the area under cultivation in oil palm increased from less than 2,000 km² to more than 30,000 km². Palm oil production is a major industry in Malaysia where the Sunda Pig-tails experienced 43.7% decline in population: from 80,000 individuals in 1957 to 45,000 in 1975. Sabah and Sarawak have become the two biggest oil palm states, ultimately, the lopping and clearing leaving Sabah’s forest with logged dipterocarp forest.<br/><br/>Many instances of conflict with human beings due to crop raiding and therefore the macaques are considered as pests. A study conducted in Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra, on crop raiding and crop raiders by Linkie <em>et al.</em> (2006), <em>Macaca nemestrina</em> was found to be one of the most frequent crop raiders and to cause significant damage than other raiders.<br/><br/>Though they can survive in logged forest they are hunted for food and as sport and during retaliatory killing for crop raiding. Along with <em>M. fascicularis</em> they account for 2% of mammal killing in Sarawak and appear low density because of hunting. These naturally rare and highly mobile species are vulnerable to local extinction through hunting around farms.&#160; Trading by quota still active in Indonesia and Sumatra is the main source of these macaques. They are used in biomedical science studies for HIV/AIDS research.<br/><br/>Densities of these macaques have been found to have marked decrease in the 1996 and 1999 surveys that the 1970s survey. A total ban on export of primates was effected in 1984. Until then, Peninsular Malaysia was the principal supplier of primates to the USA, the largest user of primates.<br/><br/>The Sunda pig-tailed macaque exists at a range of population densities and density appears to be highly habitat-specific. The Sunda pig-tailed macaque may be adaptable, as it is found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance. Despite the species’ apparent habitat plasticity, the Sunda pig-tailed macaque is largely forest dependent, but is known to readily use oil palm <em>Elaeis guineensis</em> plantations. The forests of Borneo are undergoing some of the world’s highest deforestation rates, largely as the result of the expansion of oil palm plantations, and thus such development and consequent loss of habitat, likely constitute the greatest threat to this species. Deforestation is largely occurring in the lowland regions where viable populations exist; remnant forests at elevations above ~800 m asl may not support viable populations, further exacerbating the conservation threat. Furthermore, much remnant habitat is under logging concession or conversion to plantation.<br/><br/>In addition, the effectiveness of the protected areas should be considered, as these areas seem to be strongholds for the species. Furthermore, the majority land-u<a name=""_GoBack""></a>se classification for remnant habitat is logging concession, which under selective extraction of the largest trees may further negatively impact their persistence given their reliance on the largest trees in the environment.</p>","This species is common in some parts of its range, but numbers have been severely reduced in many places due to hunting and habitat loss.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in Brunei, Indonesia (Bangka, Kalimantan Borneo, and Sumatra), Malaysia (including the Malay Peninsula and Sabah and Sarawak Borneo), and southern peninsular Thailand.<br/><br/>There are small, introduced populations on Singapore and in the Natuna Islands (Groves 2001). The precise geographic boundary between <em>M. nemestrina</em> and <em>M. leonina </em>is not well-defined. There are populations of the two taxa found on either side of the distribution limit in the Isthmus of Kra, but many of these populations are the result of release by humans.

In Pakistan this monkey remains in mountainous&#160; regions with forest cover; it is typically associated with Himalayan moist temperate&#160; forest (Roberts 1997). It is found at elevations up to 4,000 m (Molur et al. 2003).&#160; Due to hunting in Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species does not occur in commensal situations there, and is restricted to forest areas where it is generally&#160; associated with riverine environments over a range of altitudes (Timmins pers. comm.).&#160; In&#160; western and northern parts of its range it seems to occur in a wider array of environments.

As in Sundarbans, they are known to fishing on mudflats. Other animal food includes crabs, shellfish, bird eggs, honeycombs, crayfish, crabs, and spiders. Plant materials include fruits, seeds, flowers, leaves, shoots, twigs, roots, twigs, shoots, buds, stems, gums and pith.<br/> <br/> Seasonal breeding with the mating activities peaking in autumn, winter and births in spring and summer.

While <em>M. mulatta</em> exists easily around humans, the increasing level of cohabitation has been associated with waning levels of human tolerance for the animals (Molur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Confiscation for laboratory testing is a mostly localized threat, but it is considerable in certain areas (A. Kumar pers. comm.).

17951229,12560,Macaca sinica,Endangered,A2cd+4cd,2020,2015-11-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Although this is a widely distributed species on Sri Lanka, the population is suspected to have declined by more than 50% in the last 40 years (approximately three generations) due to habitat loss at an equal or slightly higher rate. The species is also threatened from persecution as a pest, and minimally from the pet industry<br/></p><p>More specifically, according to government data, during the 42-year period (1956-1993) the country lost 50% of its forest cover, and more than 70% if the last 22 years to the present are included. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number of macaques (Dittus 1977). Since 2003 a new threat has emerged: it involves translocating animals considered pests to unsuitable habitats where macaque survival is at risk (Dittus 2012a,b). In addition, there has been a loss of at least 15% of natural habitat in the Northern Dry Zone areas, especially since the end of the war in 2009 and further losses are expected (Mattsson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). The large-sized protected areas (as well as unprotected ones) in the dry and arid zones provide suitable ecological habitat in less than 2% of their areas: only along the narrow riverine forests for this water dependent species (Dittus 1977). Therefore, macaque densities in most National Parks and other remaining tracts of the dry zone forests have been estimated to be extremely low: at 0.2–0.5/km² (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, McKay 1973, Dittus 1977). Wet zone habitats (<em>M. s. aurifrons</em>) are densely populated by humans and macaques are isolated in fragmented patches and are treated as pests (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In the montane areas,&#160;<em>M. s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;is assessed here as Critically Endangered. This endemic species is threatened also by the fact that it has no legal protection but is managed as a pest species. In human-monkey conflict situations people are at liberty to kill macaque monkeys, and some commercial air-rifle sellers advertise their products with macaques as targets. The overall empirical profile for the species justifies IUCN Endangered status. Notwithstanding, the&#160;public perception of macaque numbers countrywide is highly overblown because macaques are often lured out of the forest towards refuse and crops where they are seen easily. Garbage feeding macaque populations can grow exponentially (Dittus 2012, Dittus&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). These facts, together with macaque-human conflict (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013, Cabral <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dittus <em>et al</em>. 2019), have misled some people to question the species’ overall threatened status, and therefore poses a political challenge for conservation policy and management.&#160;</p>","The species is found in a variety of forest types (Dittus, 1977) at all altitudes up to about 2,100 m (Corbet and Hill 1992).&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">Macaca sinica aurifrons&#160;</em>is found in lowland and midland tropical rainforest and wet zone lowland forests,&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">M. s. opisthomelas&#160;</em>in montane tropical rainforest, and&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">M. s. sinica&#160;</em>in the extensive dry evergreen forest near permanent water. The species is mainly arboreal and terrestrial and diurnal. It is frugivorous, but also consumes flowers, new leaf shoots, tubers, insects, and the occasional small vertebrate. It adapts easily to human foods (Hladik and Hladik, 1972, Dittus, 1977). Its local and wider geographic distributions are limited by the availability of free water; in the dry and arid zones this means that its ecological distribution is far less than suggested by the area of occupancy in red lest assessments (Dittus, 2013).","<p>The chief threat to this species is habitat loss owing to the encroachment of plantations, and fuel wood collection. Other threats include shooting, snaring and poisoning of the animals, as they are considered to be crop pests (Dittus 2012, Molur<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>According to government data, during one 42-year period (1956-1993), the country lost 50% of its forest cover and more than 50% if the last 10 years (1994-2003) are included. Over the last 15 years the rate of decline has remained the same with increasing pressures of habitat modification, forest die back, agriculture, plantations, and settlements. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number. Therefore, the species is reduced numerically minimally by 50% (Dittus 2012, Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Much of the original forested habitat of&#160;<em>M. s. aurifrons</em>&#160;in the southwest rainforest areas has been converted to agriculture, home gardens and plantations. These habitats are inimical to macaque survival because the animals are not tolerated by humans (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013, Cabral&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). In addition, 80% of hill country forests were lost to tea plantations during the 19th century. The populatoin of <em>Macaca s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;has been reduced by &gt;80% over the last 20 years. This trend is continuing as high elevation natural forests are being converted to agriculture (vegetable plots and dairy pasture) (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Dittus 2013, Gamage&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Wickramanayake and Gunatilleke 2002, Wijesundera 2012); the subspecies is assessed as Critically Endangered. The Mahaweli Development Scheme has destroyed much dry-zone forest habitat of&#160;<em>M. s. sinica&#160;</em>(Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003) and continues to impact dry zone forests (Mattson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Jayasuriya&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). The protracted civil war in Sri Lanka has had a negative impact on habitat and wildlife in the dry zone (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/><br/>The species is also persecuted due to increasing human-wildlife negative interactions throughout the range (Dittus&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Cabral&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018, Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). The declines are predicted to continue for another 2-3 decades given the increasing population impacts, development schemes, lack of political will, expanding agriculture and plantations, forest die back, tourism, linear intrusions, and general lack of habitat and wildlife promoting attitudes.<br/></p>","<p>The species is widely distributed in Sri Lanka where virtually all populations inhabiting undisturbed natural forest are in decline owed to habitat loss. The three subspecies vary in the degree of old-growth habitat remaining to support population numbers and that of the montane subspecies&#160;<em>Macaca sinica opishtomelas</em>&#160;is the most threatened. Towns, tourist and temple provides macaques access to human foods and this has developed into concentrations of conspicuous pest macaques at these sites. These sites are highly localized and do not represent macaque population numbers countywide.&#160;&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"The species as a whole is endemic to Sri Lanka. The subspecies <em>Macaca sinica sinica </em>is found in the north and east of the island, <em>M. s. aurifrons</em> in the south-west, and <em>M. s. opisthomela</em><em>s</em> in the central montane region. The species and its subspecies are very fragmented in their distribution, with the wet zone form, <em>M. s. opisthomelas</em> being highly restricted to less than 500 km² in extent of occurrence and less than 100 km² in area of occupancy (Molur <em>et al</em>., 2003; Dittus <em>et al</em>. 2018).","The species is in trade, kept as pets in the dry zone.",Terrestrial,"Although protected internationally under CITES Appendix II, this is the only endemic species not protected by law in Sri Lanka (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/><em>Macaca sinica sinica</em> occurs in the following protected areas: Menikdene Archaeological Reserve, Ritigala Reserve, Sigiriya Sanctuary, NIFS Popham Arboretum, VRR Sanctuary, Wasgamuwa NP, Angammedilla NP, Hurulu FR , Kaudulla NP,&#160;&#160;Minneriya NP, Somawathiya NP,&#160;&#160;Flood Plains NP,&#160;&#160;Maduru Oya NP, Gal Oya NP, Wilpattu NP, Yala (Ruhunu) NP,&#160;&#160;Kumana (Yala East) NP, Lahugala Kitulaga NP, Udawalawe NP (intergrades&#160;&#160;with M. s. aurifrons) , Polonnaruwa Nature Sanctuary, Kanthale Naval Sanctuary,&#160;&#160;Mihintale Sanctuary, Thangamalai Sanctuary, Kantalai FR, Elahera FR, Baddaragala Sanctuary, Kaludiyapokuna FR,&#160;&#160;Ritigala Nature Reserve.<br/><p></p><p><em>Macaca s. aurifrons</em>&#160;is known to occur in numerous protected areas, including: Attidiya-Belanwila Sanctuary, Buddaragala Sanctuary, Dombagaskande Forest Reserve, Kitulgala Sanctuary, Kurulukelle Sanctuary, Menikdena Archaelogical Reserve, Muthurajawela Sanctuary, Remmalakanda Forest Reserve, Rendenigala Sanctuary, Sinharaja Forest Reserve, Udawalawe National Park, Udawattekele Sanctuary,&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>Macaca s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;occurs in the Peak Wilderness Area (high elevations) and the Hakgala Strict Natural Reserve, and&#160;&#160;marginal areas of the Horton Plains National Park.</p>                    <p>Although listed internationally under CITES Appendix II, this is the only endemic species not protected by law within Sri Lanka (Flora and Fauna Protection [Amendment] Act, no. 22 of 2009) where the species is generally considered a &#160;pest.

Crop raiding by monkeys can be reduced by engaging professionally trained crop guardians. Human-macaque conflict reduction should be addressed as one component of a more general human-wildlife conflict challenge, and translocation of any wild animals considered as pests (macaques, purple-faced langurs, elephants) should be outlawed for the welfare of animals and humans alike (Dittus 2012 a,b; Dittus <em>et al</em>. 2019; Fernando <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

There are estimates of a continued decline of over 20% of the populations in the next approximately 25 years, along with hunting, road kills and continued loss of habitat.</p>","<p>Mainly arboreal, this species prefers the upper canopy of primary tropical evergreen rainforest (Singh <em>et al</em>. 2002) referred to as Sholas but may also be found in monsoon forest in hilly country with canopies reach 30 to 50 m and in disturbed forest. It is even known to persist in areas with human planted fruit trees such as Jack fruit, guava, passion fruit, and others, although populations fluctuate based on fruit tree availability within a forest fragment. They range in elevation from 100 to 1,800 m (Molur <em>et</em> <em>al. </em>2003).   </p><p>The species seems largely to be a seasonal breeder, with births temporally clumped along with the fruiting season dictated by monsoonal climate (Singh <em>et al.,&#160;</em>2006). In the wild females first give birth at about 80 months, and have an interbirth period of about 34.3 months. The generation length is approximately 13 years.</p>","<p>The major threat to this species today is habitat fragmentation, with many of these fragments being further decreased. In the past, habitat loss was due mainly to timber harvest and the creation of exotic plantations such as tea, eucalyptus and coffee. Habitat degradation seems to the biggest threat to the conservation of Lion-tailed Macaques wherever they occur in Kerala (Easa <em>et al</em>. 1997). In private forests and plantations, change in land use is a problem for the species. Hunting is a second major threat, especially in certain parts of its range. In one location, Coorg, with a large area of remaining wet evergreen habitat, the species is highly threatened by non-subsistence and subsistence hunting for food (Kumara and Singh 2004). In some areas, primate meat is preferred as food, and so the animals face serious hunting threats (Kumara and Singh 2004). A local trade exists for pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003), and in Coorg the animals were often hunted in the past for “medicinal” uses.&#160;</p><p>Certain features of the reproductive biology and ecology of this species (such as large interbirth periods, seasonal resource availability, and female competition for mating opportunities) combine to make it intrinsically rare in the wild. The populations already reduced to low numbers are in special need of active management (Singh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).&#160;Furthermore, the Lion-tailed Macaques in the fragmented forests of Anamalai Hills were found to have less genetic diversity compared to those in a more contiguous forest in Nelliyampathy, implying that genetic inbreeding due to fragmentation and isolation may have a detrimental effect on the long-term survival of small, isolated populations (Ram&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).</p><p></p>","<p>The total wild population is estimated to be about 4,000 individuals, made up of 47 isolated subpopulations in seven different locations; these subpopulations tend to be small and in forest fragments that are isolated from each other (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2006). There are estimated to be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals (Molur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Few subpopulations have the structure and habitat suitable for self-sustainment, where 10-15 groups share or connect their home ranges and interbreed. In the Sirsi-Honnavara rainforests of the northern Western Ghats in Karnataka, for instance, a subpopulation consisting of 32 groups in a contiguous tract of habitat exists where less than six groups survived 20 years prior in the early 1980s (Kumara and Singh 2004). Kumara and Singh (2008) estimated 451 individuals in 30 groups in Kudremukh forest complex. Recent sightings reported by Kumara and Sinha report of population in the following areas: one group in Makut Reserve Forest, four groups in Talakaveri Wildlife Sanctuary, one group in Subramanya Reserve Forest, one group in Sakaleshpur Reserve Forest, 10 groups in Kudremukh National Park. Kumara <em>et al.</em> (2011) reported a decline in habitat in Aghanashini Lion-tailed Macaque Conservation Reserve. The forests of Kerala host up to 1,216 adult lion tailed macaques, according to a large study using estimates from forest sightings (Easa <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>1997).&#160; The Anaimalai landscape support about 60 groups, though only two subpopulations there are composed of more than two groups, one has seven, the other 12 (Singh <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2002, Kumara <em>et al</em>. 2014). Overall the species is declining in forest fragments, and stable in protected areas (Molur <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, H.N. Kumara pers. comm).

It is suspected that these threats have resulted in a population decline exceeding 30% over the past 24 years (<em>ca</em> three generations) and which is unlikely to abate in the near future. The taxon therefore qualifies as VU under criterion A2cd.","Mandrills are found in evergreen rainforest, stretching between 100 and 300 km inland from the Atlantic coast, as well as in montane forest, and secondary forest. They avoid thick undergrowth areas and marshes. Mandrills are known to cross areas of savanna&#160;up to 180 m across to access forest fragments and have been known to enter plantations. They are semi-terrestrial and usually forage at less than 5 m above ground. Mandrills are omnivorous and their diverse diets&#160;include fruits, buds, leaves, roots, insects, fish, meat, crustaceans, fungus and seeds (Rogers <em>et al. </em>1996). Seeds form a more important part of the diet than the flesh of fruits, and large seeds are usually consumed (not dispersed).<br/><br/>Data on the home range of a group which is not hunted come from only one site: Lopé National Park in Gabon, where a horde of ~720 individuals has remained stable over 20 years, using 182&#160;km²&#160;of forest-savanna mosaic habitat, including 89&#160;km²&#160;of suitable forest habitat. The group used gallery forests and isolated forest fragments with high botanical diversity far more intensively that the continuous forest block (White <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">et al. </em>2010). Males travel with the female and offspring horde only during breeding (June–September) and range alone at other times of the year, visiting the group occasionally if any females become reproductively fertile outside the usual season (Abernethy <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">et al. </em>2002).&#160;Day range length for the Lopé horde averages 4.9 km per day, but for&#160;lone males&#160;is only 1 km per day.&#160;<br/><br/>Humans are the&#160;Mandrill's&#160;major predator. Leopards and pythons are also known to predate Mandrills, but Crowned Hawk Eagle is not known to. Golden Cat and smaller carnivores are also not known to take Mandrills.","Mandrills appear to be most seriously threatened in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.This species is affected by the destruction of its evergreen forest habitat since this reduces the capacity of environments to support Mandrill populations. However, the most immediate threat is posed by poaching for their meat (Abernethy and White 2013, Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013). Large males are preferentially targeted. Commercial bushmeat hunters pose a particular threat to populations that are located close to main roads and towns. Annual offtakes per hunted horde&#160;are likely to be lower&#160;for modern day hunters using guns and snares than in the past when hunters used dogs and nets, which could result in very high offtakes (&gt;20% of the group in one hunt). However, impacts are more widely spread across the species' geographic range.","Total numbers of mandrills are unknown, but it is suspected that the species has declined significantly in recent years. Mandrills range in large hordes of several hundred individuals (Abernethy <em>et al. </em>2002, Hongo 2014), but groups in areas suffering intense subsistence hunting pressure (notably Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea) are reported to be much smaller and they have been extirpated from some areas. The largest remaining populations are to be found in Gabon.&#160;Intact forest can support densities of around 10 individuals/km², but distribution is likely to be patchy and densities much lower in areas that have experienced long-term hunting pressure.",Decreasing,"Mandrills are found in moist evergreen rainforest in central west Africa, south of the Sanaga River (Cameroon) through to mainland Equatorial Guinea, much of southern Gabon, and south-western Republic of Congo to the Kouilou River, and down to the Congo River. Inland, the lower Ivindo River and Ogooué River in Gabon limit its distribution to the east, but on two occasions mandrills have been recorded in the Garabinzam area of northwestern Congo, east of the Upper Ivindo (Fay 1989, Allam<em> et al. </em>2016). In Cameroon, mandrills have been recorded in the Dja&#160;Biosphere&#160;&#160;Reserve using with camera traps, and this appears to be at the northwestern limit of their range (Bata <em>et al</em>. 2017). Camera traps have also recorded mandrills at the source of the Ogooué,&#160;extending the species' range a little into the Batéké Plateaux National Park in Gabon (Hedwig <em>et al. </em>2017). Mandrills do not occur in south-east Cameroon or east of the Congo River. The Ogooué River bisects the species range, separating them into two distinct populations: i) Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and northern Gabon and ii) southern Gabon and Congo (Telfer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003).","Mandrill carcasses have been recorded for sale in both rural and urban markets in all four range states in each of the past 15 years (www.offtake.org). In two extensive surveys of village hunters in Gabon, mandrills were the second rarest catch, accounting for &lt;1% of village offtakes by number of animals in each site (Coad 2007, van Vliet 2008). The price of Mandrill meat in provincial towns in Gabon in 2014 was around $4 per kg, which was not significantly different to the average price of other bushmeats.",Terrestrial,"Mandrills are listed under Appendix I of CITES, and as Class B under the African Convention. There are many parks and reserves in the Mandrill's range, and their presence has been confirmed in at least one protected area in each range state and in most of the protected areas in their geographic range. Surveys are urgently needed to determine where viable populations still exist outside protected areas, and whether the populations in protected areas are at risk of isolation and fragmentation.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Reasons included the very limited range with relatively high human population, ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting. In recent years, field studies have been carried out, and new protected areas and monitoring programmes established; however, the species continues to face high hunting pressures (Linder and Oates 2011) and threats to remaining habitats from logging and agriculture, in addition to renewed threats from large-scale plantation establishments and road construction. These ongoing threats are believed to have reduced the population by &gt;50% over the last 30 years (<em>ca</em> three generations) on Bioko (Cronin <em>et al.</em> In Review), and some mainland sub-populations have become locally extinct or may face extirpation in the near future (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2013, D.T. Cronin pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>Given a suspected population reduction of &gt;50% in the past (based on a suspected decline in area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO), and habitat quality), and for which the causes have not ceased, the species is assessed as Endangered.</p>","<p>Drills occur in closed forest from coastal lowland to transition and semi-montane forests; these give way to forest-savannah mosaic and high-altitude grassland with gallery forest where Drills are absent. In the 1930s, Sanderson (1937) collected Drills in mixed grassland-gallery forest of Cameroon’s Bamenda Highlands but these forests are now largely eliminated. &#160;It should be noted that within the core of Drill range, vast tracts of drill habitat were systematically cleared for palm, rubber, tea and banana plantations in the last 80 years from Mount Cameroon east to Douala. Across their limited range, there is a single long dry season from December–March; Bioko I. is wetter.<br/><br/>Drills are a semi-terrestrial species that travel on the ground and sleep in the trees at night at heights from 10 m up to the forest canopy. They are omnivorous, opportunistic, wide-ranging foragers; fruits and seeds dominate their diet that includes other plant materials and animal matter (Astaras 2009, Astaras and Waltert 2010). Drill groups forage mostly on the ground, with some animals feeding in tree branches above; they may ascend to the canopy to feed on fruits and blossoms. They live in multi-male, multi-female groups of 15-75 individuals (Astaras 2009) with an approximate ratio of adult males to other group members of 1:20 (Gartlan 1970, Schaaf <em>et al</em>. 2013). Larger groups are thought to be aggregations of sub-groups at the 1:20 ratio. Groups may periodically come together to form super-groups of &gt;100 animals; super-grouping behaviour is not recorded for <em>poensis</em>, and appears to be decreasing on the mainland as group density decreases. Only solitary adult or subadult male Drills have been recorded (Gartlan 1970, Gadsby 1990, Astaras 2009). It is unclear whether Drill groups maintain a fixed home range; they have been recorded year-round in Korup and Ebo, where the most substantial subpopulations are believed to survive, but have been reported as seasonal in other habitats.</p>","<p>Drills occupy a relatively small range with an extent of occurrence 63,074 km², including Bioko and the mainland. The area of occupancy for this species is believed to be smaller than 20,000 km², fragmented into three or four populations in Nigeria, at least six in Cameroon, and two on Bioko. Some mainland subpopulations are contiguous with one another across the Nigeria-Cameroon border. Further fragmentation and isolation amongst the mainland subpopulations is likely to be ongoing, and the two most important of these, in Korup National Park and the proposed Ebo National Park, are distant and permanently isolated from one another.<br/><br/>The species is threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation and hunting. Habitat loss results from forest clearance on a small but extensive scale for farms, particularly in Nigeria, for large-scale plantations, particularly in Cameroon where multiple oil palm plantation projects are underway or proposed (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2013), and from commercial logging in Cameroon where several important forests peripheral to Korup are now designated as concessions (C. Astaras pers. comm. 2016). Other proposed developments posing new risks to remaining habitat include road building in Cameroon, Nigeria and on Bioko, and associated human activities. Legal and illegal logging across their range remains a threat; in addition to sheer loss of habitat, logging opens roads for cultivators, and provides new access to hunters and bush meat traders. Drills are hunted commercially for their meat, and several group members may be shot en masse if hunting dogs are used (Gadsby 1990, Astaras 2009, Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2013). Excessive hunting has resulted in marked declines, especially in smaller, isolated forest fragments from some of which, drills have been extirpated (Waltert <em>et al.</em> 2002, Linder and Oates 2011, Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>National, local or community programs legally protect the most important habitats for Drill monkeys in all three countries where they occur, but compliance is low to moderate, at best, and enforcement in all protected areas is inadequate.</p>","<p>Drills were suspected to be possibly extinct in Nigeria and on Bioko as recently as the 1980s (Oates 1986). While they are no longer common in any part of their range, they survive in fragmented forests across most of their original range. A population reduction of over 50% is suspected over the past three generations.<br/><br/>In Nigeria, Drills persist in the Cross River National Park and adjoining forests, including the Mbe Mountains, and in the Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary.&#160; The total population in Nigeria is estimated to be between 1,000 and 1,200 but could be lower. In Cameroon, Astaras (2009) estimated the entire Korup region, which is the core of the species range, to contain 2,500-3,000 drills, and Morgan <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimated 750 drills in the Ebo region, the second most important population in Cameroon. Together with other areas, the drill population in Cameroon could be as high as 5,000 but could be as low as 3,000. Approximately 75% of the Drill population lives in Cameroon (Gadsby and Zinner 2013).<br/><br/>On Bioko, Drills have undergone an estimated decline of up to 70% in the 30 years (<em>ca</em> three generations) from 1986 to 2016, mainly due to hunting; fewer than 1,000 are estimated to remain on Bioko (D.T. Cronin pers. comm. 2016).</p>Recent data from Korup region in Cameroon report declining encounter rates within the national park (Linder and Oates 2011, J. Linder pers. comm. 2016) and local extirpations in the periphery (Waltert <em>et al</em>. 2002) due to hunting. Recent data is lacking for other sub-populations, which are suspected to be decreasing due to continued loss of habitat and poor enforcement of protection measures across the species’ entire range. Outside of Korup and Ebo National Parks, populations in Cameroon are believed to be facing potential extirpation.",Decreasing,"The Drill has a very restricted distribution from the Cross River in southeast Nigeria, east to the Mbam River in western Cameroon, where the Sanaga River serves as the southern boundary. The forest-derived savannah boundary limits the Drill’s distribution inland from the coast. Drills are also present on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. Drills occupy a relatively small range with an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 63,074 km² (including Bioko and the mainland). Its area of occupancy (AOO) is believed to be less than 20,000 km², fragmented into at least 10 permanently isolated habitat areas on the mainland<br/><br/>There are two subspecies: <em>M. l. leucophaeus</em> on the mainland, and <em>M. l. poensis</em> on Bioko Island.","Drills are typically hunted opportunistically, as are other species locally, but targeted hunts using multiple hunting dogs can occur when Drill groups are detected near villages (Astaras 2009). In some areas, Drills may be considered a favoured bush meat and adult males are a high value target due to their large size and fatty flesh.&#160; Most hunting is for commercial rather than subsistence purposes, with the end consumers being urban dwellers with the financial means to purchase bush meat.",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed under Appendix I of CITES and as Class B under the African Convention. Drill Monkeys are fully protected by legislation in the three countries where they live.<br/><br/>In Cameroon, Drill monkeys occur in Korup, Takamanda, Bakossi and Mount Cameroon National Parks; the proposed Ebo National Park; and the Banyang Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary.&#160; They persist in other forests peripheral to these protected areas (e.g. Nta Ali, Mawne and Rumpi Hills Forest Reserves) as well as smaller habitat fragments (Morgan et al. 2013).&#160; In Nigeria, Drills persist in Oban and Okwangwo Divisions of Cross River National Park; Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary and the Mbe Mountains Community Forest (Gadsby and Zinner, 2013).&#160; On Bioko Island, Drills are found in Gran Caldera de Luba Scientific Reserve and believed to persist in the Pico Basile National Park.<br/><br/>A well established, captive breeding programme for the mainland subspecies manages a large, genetically diverse population at an <em>in situ </em>facility in Nigeria; another captive population is managed in Cameroon (Gadsby, 2002).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The decline is possibly on the order of about 20-25% in the past 30 years (a three-generation period). Their adaptability to a wide variety of habitats has enabled them to remain locally common in many areas where the species occurs. The species is currently listed as Near Threatened, under criterion A2cd.","<p>This species inhabits woodlands, savanna, and Sahelian steppe, always within reach of water (e.g., Vale <em>et al</em>. 2015b). It also inhabits gallery forests and secondary forest in the south of its range. In Guinea-Bissau, the species has been observed using mangrove forests for sleeping and foraging. Rich food resources and good protection in the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal allow often large aggregations of one-male units, numbering 10-200 (sometimes &gt;500) individuals, to forage together. This population exhibits a multi-level system similar to Hamadryas Baboons. Therefore, there are sometimes small groups, other times larger groupings (Fischer et al. 2017; Patzelt et al. 2011).</p><p>In Guinea-Bissau, groups of approximately 100 individuals have been observed, but foraging groups seem to be smaller (approximately 30-50 individuals). Guinea Baboons eat seeds, shoots, roots, fruits, fungi, invertebrates, small vertebrates, and eggs. Where agriculture has expanded, rice, maize, yams, groundnuts, and other cultivated crops are also taken (Sá <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p><p>In Mauritania, given the general arid conditions of the Tagant, Assaba, and Afollé mountains, Guinea Baboons are typically found close to bodies of water, especially near rock pools (locally known as <em>gueltas</em>) along mountain rivers (Brito <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>The realized ecological niche of Mauritanian populations is apparently distinct from that of southern populations, a consequence of the unusually arid conditions of Mauritania (Vale <em>et al</em>. 2015a). In a regional analysis of biogeographical traits of the mammals of West Sahara-Sahel, Guinea Baboons exhibited very low niche breadth suggesting high specialization within the region (Vale <em>et al</em>. 2016).","<p>Outside the Niokolo-Koba National Park, this species has undergone widespread declines due to extensive agricultural expansion, tree-felling, and direct hunting for crop protection and for meat in Guinea and Mali. In the past, large numbers were exported for laboratory use, particularly from Senegal. &#160;</p><p>In Mauritania, the main threats are climatic oscillations and competition with human activities for water resources. Past droughts have resulted in rock pools drying out, which has caused local extinction of other fauna (Trape 2009, Brito <em>et al</em>. 2011, Vale <em>et al</em>. 2015b). Several rock pools are overexploited by herdsmen, which causes water-shortage during the dry season, fecal contamination by domestic animals, and increased activities for excavating pools or pumping water. Local studies are needed to quantify pressures and threat risks to baboon populations in Mauritania.</p><p>Baboon populations in Guinea-Bissau have been declining due to habitat degradation and/or loss and hunting, since the 1970s (Cá 2008) and the 80s (Casanova and Sousa 2007, Ferreira da Silva 2012). The species has been hunted for meat consumption and trade, for the trade of skins for traditional medicine and magic practices, in hunting events organized by the military during moments of political instability and killed by farmers during crop-foraging episodes (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003, Casanova and Sousa, 2007, Ferreira da Silva 2012, Costa <em>et al</em>. 2013, <a name=""_Hlk490129592"">Minhós </a><em>et al.</em> 2013, S<a name=""_Hlk490129217"">á</a> <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ferreira da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the south of the country, where baboons are believed to be relatively common (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003), residents claim to see baboons less frequently and hunters state that baboons are becoming increasingly hard to find, particularly in the last two decades (Casanova and Sousa 2007, Cá 2008, Ferreira da Silva 2012, Costa <em>et al</em>. 2013, Amador <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the south, baboon meat has been frequently used as a source of protein in replacement of domestic meat in southern sections of the country (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2013) and hunters stated during interviews that they would hunt one or two baboons per day, four or five times a week (Ferreira da Silva 2012). In the capital city, primate carcasses are sold whole in meat markets to private customers and to specialized restaurants (Casanova and Sousa 2007, Starin 2010, Ferreira da Silva 2012, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). Data collected at two of the bushmeat markets in Bissau suggested the trade of a minimum of 283 baboons per dry season (from November to May; Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). Urban bushmeat vendors base the carcass prices on the specimens’ body size. Thus, male baboons, being the largest of all primate species traded at the Guinea-Bissau bushmeat markets, are sold at a price 60% higher than any other primate carcass (approximately 22-33 USD vs. 8-16 USD for baboon females and carcasses of any other primate species (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). Baboon meat is consumed in specialized urban bushmeat restaurants as a snack while alcoholic beverages are served (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013, <a>Ferreira da Silva <em>et al.</em> 201</a>8). Probably as a consequence of hunting practices towards adult females, it is also very common to observe young individuals being kept as pets, even within protected areas (Casanova and Sousa 2007, Hockings and Sousa 2011). Human hunting practices have been proposed as a factor shaping the population structure and dispersal patterns of Guinea baboons (Ferreira da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014; <a>Ferreira da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2018).</a>&#160;The population size of Guinea baboons for southern Guinea-Bissau (encompassing the protected areas of Cantanhez Forests National Park, Cufada Lagoons Natural Park, Dulombi National Park and Boé National Park) has been estimated in 2 399 to 3 981 reproductive individuals using molecular tools (<a>Ferreira da Silva et al under review</a>).</p><p>As mentioned above, Guinea Baboons are reportedly kept as pets in some parts of their range and their skins have been observed as part of ju-ju practices in The Gambia (C. Barlow, pers. obs. 2017).</p>","<p>Guinea Baboons are reported to be common in many parts of their range (e.g., The Gambia, Senegal, northern Guinea, and southeastern Guinea-Bissau, within protected areas) and, although patchily distributed, appear to be relatively abundant in a few additional locations. Nevertheless, in Guinea-Bissau, baboons are rare outside protected areas. Human activity (hunting, habitat encroachment) appears to be impacting population numbers in most locations. As such, a population reduction of 20% over the past three generations is suspected.</p><p>In Senegal, group size can temporarily reach several hundred individuals (Patzelt <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Mauritania, group size ranges from less than 10 individuals up to 50 individuals, but most groups contain fewer than 20 (Brito pers. obs. 2016).<a name=""_GoBack""></a></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Guinea Baboon, a monotypic species, is endemic to West Africa. It ranges from southern Mauritania and western Mali, through parts of The Gambia and Senegal, to Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and northwestern Sierra Leone. The northern limit of this range is not well known, but appears to have shifted south due to decreasing rainfall (Verschuren, in Galat-Luong and Galat 2013). Furthermore, recent surveys confirm the species ranges further east than has been previously suggested (Kopp <em>et al</em>. 2014, Vale <em>et al</em>. 2015a).</p><p>Niokola Koba National Park, in Senegal, remains a stronghold for the Guinea Baboon. Outside the protection of the national park, however, their numbers appear to be declining in the country (D. Zinner, pers. obs. 2016). Some fragmented populations still occur in other regions, e.g., the Réserve Naturelle Communautaire du Boundou in eastern Senegal (Kopp <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kopp 2015) and parts of Casamance (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2006). Specifically, they exist in upper and middle Casamance, but are not in the Parc Basse Casamance (J. Carter, pers. comm. 2017). The range of a reintroduced group of the species in Saloum has expanded in recent years (Galat-Luong and Galat 2013).<br/><br/>Guinea Baboons are abundant in northern Guinea, in the Fouta Djallon area, where there is a local taboo against eating this species. However, hunting pressure in the southern and eastern parts of Guinea has driven the numbers down where populations are highly fragmented and mainly restricted to the peaks of hills and mountains. Baboons have been observed in the area north of Siguiri in Guinea, but it is unclear whether those occurring south of the Niger River are Guinea or olive baboons (G. Kopp, pers. obs. 2012).<br/><br/>In Mali, Guinea Baboons are found in the Boucle du Baoulé National Park, but outside this area their numbers have decreased drastically. Faecal samples collected in western Mali were identified as those from Guinea Baboons, but recent assessment of southern Mali indicates little evidence of their presence there (G. Kopp, pers. obs. 2012).<br/><br/>Their current presence in Sierra Leone is uncertain (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998); baboons in the north and northeastern part of the country are <em>Papio anubis</em> (Wallis, unpublished report).<br/><br/>In The Gambia, Guinea Baboons occur in Kiang West National Park LRR, Gambia River National Park (Baboon Islands) CRR, and possibly Bao-bolon Wetland Reserve North Bank Region (north of the river). They are also present in some forest parks, e.g., Kunkilling Community FP CRR south of the river (C. Barlow, pers. obs. 2017). Since 1998, Guinea Baboons have appeared at Pirang Bonto Forest Park and at Kiti forest, both forest fragments in Western Division, coastal Gambia south of the river&#160;(C. Barlow, pers. obs., 2020). They are common and locally abundant&#160;outside protected areas in some areas of The Gambia.<br/><br/>In Mauritania, the Guinea Baboon is restricted to the southern mountain massifs of Tagant, Assaba and Afollé (Brito <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vale <em>et al</em>. 2015a, 2016). Ecological niche-based modeling of the distribution of Guinea Baboons suggests that Mauritanian populations may be isolated from southern populations and that Tagant/Assaba populations may be isolated from those in the Afollé Mountains (Vale <em>et al</em>. 2015a).<br/><br/>In Guinea-Bissau, the Guinea Baboon is present in the south and east sections of the country (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003; Casanova and Sousa 2007; Cá 2008; Ferreira da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is relatively common in the Cantanhez Woodlands National Park, Cufada Lagoons Natural Park, and Dulombi -Boé - Tchetche Complex (DBT), but is rare outside protected areas (Ferreira da Silva, pers. obs. 2016) and absent from areas near urban centers (the capital city - Bissau - and towns, such as Buba, Bafatá and Bambadinca. Ferreira da Silva, pers. obs. 2016). The species is not reported occurring in the northwest part of the country (Limoges 1989).<br/><br/>Along its eastern (and possibly southern) limits, the Guinea Baboon has likely hybridized with the larger olive baboon (<em>Papio anubis</em>); intermediate individuals have been observed in Mali (Pollock in Sharman 1981), but little is known about this hybrid zone (Sarmiento 1998; Zinner 2013; Kopp 2015; Teixera 2016).</p>","<p>This species has undergone widespread declines due in part to direct hunting for crop protection and for meat in Guinea and Mali. In the past, large numbers were exported for laboratory use, particularly from Senegal. &#160;</p><p>In Guinea-Bissau, baboon populations have been declining due partly to hunting since the 1970s (Cá 2008) and the 80s (Casanova and Sousa 2007). The species has been hunted for meat consumption and trade, for the trade of skins for traditional medicine and magic practices, in hunting events organized by the military during moments of political instability and killed by farmers during crop-raiding episodes (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003, Casanova and Sousa, 2007, Ferreira da Silva 2012, Costa <em>et al</em>. 2013, Minhós <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sá <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ferreira da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the south of the country, where baboons are believed to be relatively common (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003), residents claim to see baboons less frequently and hunters state that baboons are becoming increasingly hard to find, particularly in the last two decades (Casanova and Sousa 2007, Cá 2008, Ferreira da Silva 2012, Costa <em>et al</em>. 2013, Amador <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the south, baboon meat has been frequently used as a source of protein in replacement of domestic meat in southern sections of the country (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2013) and hunters stated during interviews that they would hunt one or two baboons per day, four or five times a week (Ferreira da Silva 2012). In the capital city, primate carcasses are sold whole in meat markets to private customers and to specialized restaurants (Casanova and Sousa 2007, Starin 2010, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). Data collected at two of the bushmeat markets in Bissau suggested the trade of a minimum of 283 baboons per dry season (from November to May; Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). Baboon meat is consumed in specialized urban bushmeat restaurants as a snack while alcoholic beverages are served (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). Probably as a consequence of hunting practices, it is also very common to observe young individuals being kept as pets, even within protected areas (Casanova and Sousa 2007, Hockings and Sousa 2011).</p>Guinea Baboons are reportedly kept as pets in some parts of their range and their skins have been observed as part of ju-ju practices in The Gambia (C.

Following recent urban development in the mountains of south-western Saudi Arabia, local populations of <em>Papio hamadryas</em> have increased in numbers around cities (Biquand <em>et al.</em> 1994).","This species inhabits arid subdesert, steppe, hillsides, escarpments, and mountains bordering the Red Sea, generally at altitudes up to 1,500 m. However, it appears to be seasonally migratory in at least some parts of its range in Ethiopia, where bands may move up into neighbouring mountainous areas (up to 3,300 m in the Simien Mountains National Park) in the wet season. This species is dependent on water, and is never found far from water sources. It is an opportunistic omnivore, and seasonally important foods include grass, buds, invertebrates, and the fruits of desert plants (notably heglig Balanites and buffalo thorn Ziziphus). The basic social unit consists of one male and several females.","There are no major range-wide threats at present, although locally it may be at risk through loss of habitat due to major agricultural expansion and irrigation projects. In addition, adult males are hunted for their skins (which are used to embellish ceremonial cloaks in Ethiopia). They were formerly trapped in large numbers for medical research.","This species is abundant, with the majority of the population in Ethiopia, and may even have increased because of loss of predators and small-scale agriculture.

It is often persecuted as a crop raider and hunted for bushmeat in some locations. However, there are currently no major threats believed to be resulting in a range-wide population decline.","<p>The Olive Baboon inhabits a wide variety of habitats, including semi-desert, thorn scrub and open savanna. Most often, however, they are found in woodland and forest-mosaic habitats that may include high-elevation forest, gallery forest and rainforest up to 2,500 m in elevation. They are also found in rocky hills; some populations live in broad areas where woodlands have overtaken volcanic rock craters, such as those seen in northeastern Nigeria (Wallis pers. obs. 2005). They can readily persist in secondary and/or highly fragmented vegetation, including cultivated areas. Because water is a limiting factor, troops will travel long distances to find it. On occasion, they dig into semi-dry riverbeds to make small pools to access water.</p><p>Olive Baboons are omnivorous opportunists; their diet varies and adapts according to region, season and time of day. They eat mainly fruits and leaves, as well as flowers, seeds, shoots, buds, tuberous roots, bark, bulbs, twigs, sap, mushrooms and lichens (Zinner 2013). In dry seasons, they may use fallback foods such as resin, gum and bark. Olive Baboons eat animal prey, including a variety of invertebrates, lizards, birds, reptile and bird eggs and small mammals. The later include some primate species such as infant <em>Chlorocebus</em> spp. When meat-eating occurs, it typically involves randomly “stumbling” upon the item and eating it. Rarely does active hunting occur. When it does, it is individual hunting and not a cooperative organized group hunting such as that seen in Chimpanzees (Palombit 2013).</p><p>Because they often live near human habitations, Olive Baboons raid crops and garbage dumps. Thus, their diet can also include a variety of cultivated crops such as sugarcane, corn, bananas and beans. Crop-raiding can vary considerably; peaks in consumption may be associated with forest fruit shortages in some areas (see Naughton-Treves <em>et al.</em> 1998).</p><p>The species typically forages in extended, well-spaced troops that may occasionally number up to 200 animals, although more typically average about 80 individuals. As with most other baboons, the species is not territorial but instead uses home ranges that may overlap with other troops’ ranges. Home ranges vary in size and daily movements are usually less than 7 km (Zinner 2013). In addition to food and water, home ranges must contain suitable sleeping sites. For Olive Baboons, these typically require large trees and rocky outcroppings.</p><p>                             </p><p>Olive Baboons typically live in multimale-multifemale troops, although some uni-male troops have been reported in West Africa. Extensive review and summary of the Olive Baboon’s social structure, behaviour, anatomy and reproduction may be found in Palombit (2013) and Zinner (2013).</p>","<p>There are currently no major threats to this species that reduce population numbers across its range. However, some populations are under local pressure from agriculture and development projects. Although not well documented, they are hunted for bushmeat in some areas (Wallis pers. obs. Tanzania 1991, Wallis pers. obs. in Nigeria 2006–2008, van Vliet <em>et al</em>. 2012). The potential for increased hunting pressure should be monitored. With rising numbers in the human population and declining numbers of other wildlife species, Olive Baboons may eventually become a more sought-after target; at 30 kg, an adult male provides a substantial source of protein. It should be noted that Olive Baboons have been found to harbour Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses (SIV) (Peeters <em>et al.</em> 2002) and Ebola virus (Leroy <em>et al.</em> 2004), thus highlighting the health risks of baboon meat consumption to humans.</p>  <p>Both <em>Papio anubis</em> and <em>P. cynocephalus</em> are naturally infected with <em>Treponema pallidum</em> subspecies <em>pertenue</em>, the bacterium that causes human yaws and closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis (<em>T. p. pallidum</em>) (see Harper <em>et al</em>. 2012, Chuma <em>et al</em>. 2019). In <em>Papio</em> sp., the infection appears to spread through sexual contact and is associated with open lesions in and around the genitalia of both sexes. The degree of morbidity varies, including some cases of deaths occurring in the Tanzania’s Gombe National Park’s Olive Baboons, when the genitalia are so badly damaged that urinary flow was obstructed (Wallis and Lee 1999). Similar lesions appear in some other Olive Baboon populations throughout their range, most notably in Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania (Chuma <em>et al.</em> 2019) and Yankari Game Reserve in Nigeria (Wallis pers. obs. 2007).</p>  <p>Thus, although hunting pressure, persecution for crop-raiding and incidence of disease transmission do not currently constitute “major threats”, both phenomena merit attention and monitoring.</p>","<p>The Olive Baboon is widespread and locally common despite trapping, shooting and poisoning campaigns in parts of their range.</p>",Stable,"<p>Olive Baboons are the most extensively distributed of the baboons. They range throughout the Sahelian woodland and forest-mosaic habitats from southern Mauritania and Mali eastward through the Sudan to central Somalia. The range extends southwards as far as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania. Outlying populations inhabit the Tibesti and Air massifs in the Sahara (in Niger and Chad) and in the Pare and Usambara Mountains of Tanzania.</p>  <p>In East Africa, the distribution appears to be actively changing. In fact, wherever the range of Olive Baboons encounters that of other <em>Papio</em> species, there are hybrid zones. For example, Olive Baboons form a narrow hybrid zone with <em>P. hamadryas</em> below the Awash Falls and elsewhere in northern Ethiopia and hybridize with <em>P. cynocephalus</em> in the eastern part of Tsavo and Amboseli National Parks in Kenya.</p>  <p>In the clinal hybrid zone of <em>P. anubis</em> x <em>P. cynocephalus</em> between Laikipia District, just to the northeast and east of Mt. Kenya, and the Lower Tana River, near the Kenya coast, the baboons are intermediate and cannot be readily allocated to either <em>P. anubis</em> or <em>P. cynocephalus. They </em>become increasingly “yellow-like” in their phenotypes towards the Kenya Coast (De Jong and Butynski 2009, Zinner 2013). <em>Papio anubis</em> x <em>P. cynocephalus</em> hybrids are found near the Pare and Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. They are sympatric with a number of other primate species, including Chimpanzees (<em>Pan</em> <em>troglodytes</em>), <em>Chlorocebus</em> spp., several <em>Cercopithecus</em> species and <em>Erythrocebus patas</em>, across their range.<em></em></p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Hunting of Olive Baboons occurs in parts of their range, particularly in the west.

17953422,20229,Simias concolor,Critically Endangered,A2acd,2020,2015-11-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is listed as Critically Endangered because a population decline of 80-90% over the last 36 years (three generations) is estimated due to heavy hunting pressure and extensive habitat loss (especially on southern islands but quite significant throughout species range). It has been relatively well studied and thus documentation is fairly recent and intensive (Whittaker 2006). However, there is need for further extensive research across its entire range.</p>","<p>Pig-tailed Langurs are found in swamp forests and lowland rainforests (Tenaza 1987, Quinten 2010), as well as in primary forests on the hillsides of the islands‘ interior regions (Tilson 1977); they have also been spotted in habitat mosaics of primary and secondary forest (Paciulli 2004). The species occurs sympatrically with <em>Presbytis siberu, Macaca siberu</em> and <em>Hylobates klossii</em> (<em>S. c. siberu</em> on Siberut) as well as with <em>Presbytis potenziani, Macaca pagensis</em> and <em>Hylobates klossii</em> (<em>S. c. concolor</em> on the three southern Mentawai Islands). On Siberut, the interspecific overlap of <em>Simias</em> and <em>Presbytis</em> home ranges can be up to 100 % (Hadi et al 2010). Generally, the home range size for <em>Simias</em> seems to vary considerably across the archipelago and sizes between 3 and 30 ha have been recorded at different study sites (Tenaza and Fuentes 1995). The species is diurnal, semi-terrestrial, and primarily folivorous (D. Whittaker pers. comm.), feeding mainly on leaves, fruit supplements, seeds and flowers. Social organization varies and is often defined as ‘monandrous’ meaning one adult male and one or two adult female, however, multi-male, multi female groups have also been observed. Despite an early report that births were restricted to June and July (Tilson 1977), a more recent study determined that breeding in this species is not strictly seasonal (Erb et al 2012a). Pig-tailed Langurs are typically shy of humans and when alarmed, they are known to hide behind foliage but when further threatened, drop to the ground and flee.</p>","<p>This species is threatened mainly by heavy hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006, Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is also threatened by the conversion of rainforest into oil palm plantations, as well as forest clearing and product extraction by local people. Sometimes, animals are taken for the pet trade (Whittaker 2006).<br/><br/>Over the last two to three decades, hunting pressure has increased because of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been progressively eroded due to missionary and state influences (Whittaker 2006; Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>S. concolor </em>is the preferred game species of most Mentawai hunters (Mitchell and Tilson 1986, Fuentes 2002, Paciulli 2004, Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). Tenaza (1989) estimated that twice as many individuals are killed by hunters each year as are born in the Pagai Islands. On Siberut Island, interview surveys in 50 villages revealed that 24% of the respondents were ‘active hunters’ and 77% of those respondents target <em>Simias concolor.</em> The average number hunted per three months was 1.9 and a minimum off-take of over 1,600 individuals per year (&gt;10 % of the total population) was estimated (Quinten <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2014). Hunting also appears to reduce group size, and to significantly affect adult sex ratios as well as the number of immatures in groups (Erb <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Consumption as well as cultural/ceremonial reasons were most often given as a justification for hunting the species (Quinten <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2014).<br/><br/>At present, the Pig-tailed Snub-nosed Langur is listed on the IUCN Red List (Ver 3.1) as “Critically Endangered” on the basis of criteria A2cd; this equally applies to its two subspecies, <em>S. c. concolor</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>S.c. siberu</em>. It means that the species along with its subspecies was assessed to be at an “extremely high risk of extinction” due to “(A) An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population reduction (2) of ≥80% over the last 10 years or three generations […] based on (c) a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat and (d) actual or potential levels of exploitation” (see Whittaker 2006). From its first evaluation up until the previous one in 2008,&#160;<em>Simias concolor</em>&#160;was listed as “Endangered” (IUCN 2008). Whittaker (2006) explicitly details the reasons for the upgrade to Critically Endangered in her Conservation Action Plan for the Mentawai Primates:<br/><br/>“The most recent survey of <em>Simias </em>density was conducted in the Pagai Islands, where densities ranged from 5 individuals/km² in unlogged forest to 2.5 individuals/km² in forest patches logged 20 years ago (Paciulli 2004). If about 2,700 km² of primate habitat remains in the Mentawai Islands, then there are 6,700–7,300 simakobu monkeys today, representing a decline of 33 –75% from the 1980 estimate of 19,000 simakobu monkeys in Siberut (26,000&#160;in all four Mentawai Islands). The loss may have been even greater than this estimate: more recently, the mean population density for Simias throughout the Mentawais, based on home range sizes, was estimated as 21 individuals/km² (Tenaza and Fuentes 1995). Based on this density and a very conservative estimate of 3,000 km² of forest, there were 63,000 simakobus in 1994, indicating a possible loss of 73–90% of the population in 10 years. The loss is likely greater in the Pagai Islands, where logging has been more of a problem and hunting has been facilitated by logging roads, than in Siberut. The primary threat to Simias is hunting, as it is the preferred game of most Mentawai hunters (Mitchell and Tilson 1986, Fuentes 2002, Paciulli 2004). In 1990, Tenaza and Fuentes (1995) found no simakobu monkeys in a site in Siberut that had an unusually high density (~220 individuals/km²) when surveyed by Watanabe (1981) in 1974–1978. The site had been logged, and after logging had ceased, local people reported that hunting the simakobus was easier because there were fewer places for them to hide (Tenaza and Fuentes 1995). This evidence of heavy hunting suggests the higher estimate of decline may be more correct.”<br/><br/>The situation for this primate, as described above by Whittaker, remains virtually unchanged until today, with hunting and habitat loss still being the main threats: Previous estimates put the entire Siberut subspecies at 6,000-15,500 individuals (Whittaker 2006), although more recent data suggest that ca. 14,112 individuals (range: 8,252-24,133) live within Siberut National Park alone, an area covering over 40 % of the northern island. At the same time, much of the area outside the park is designated production forest and agricultural area, so – with few exceptions (e.g. Peleonan Forest in N-Siberut) – it is questionable whether this species still survives in high densities outside the park. Furthermore, the hunting threat has recently been quantified for the first time, painting a somewhat bleak picture: An average annual off-take of between 1,600 and 3,200 individuals was estimated (Quinten et al<em>&#160;</em>2014), which - based on Whittaker’s estimates - would mean anything between 10 and 50 % of the population. While no recent data are available from the three southern islands, the old estimates of only 700-1,800 individuals (Whittaker 2006) are quite low, illustrating that&#160;<em>S. s. concolor</em>&#160;is urgently in need of protective measures.<br/><br/>On this basis, it is recommend that the status of&#160;<em>S. concolor</em>&#160;should be maintained as Critically Endangered, and this should apply equally to both subspecies.&#160;</p>","<p>In 2006, the population estimate for the species as a whole was 6,700–17,300 individuals, down from an estimated population of 26,000 in 1980 (Whittaker 2006). This represents a decline of 33–75% over 26 years (1980-2006). Over the last 10 years it is estimated to have undergone a further decline; it is therefore estimated that the population has declined by over 80% in 36 years (three generations).<br/><br/><strong><em>Simias concolor concolor</em></strong><strong><br/> </strong>The most recent surveys of this species estimated densities of five individuals/km² in unlogged forest, and 2.5 individuals in forest patches logged 20 years ago (Paciulli 2004). Its mean population density was estimated at 21 individuals/km² in 1994 (Tenaza and Fuentes 1995). This would indicate a decline of 73 to 90% in 10 years (Whittaker 2006). Most likely, the species has been driven to extinction on two of the islets at the South of South Pagai Island (Yanuar <em>et al.</em> 1998). With its total population estimated to number only 700-1,800 individuals (Whittaker 2006), <em>S. c. concolor</em> is urgently in need of protective measures.</p><p><strong><em>Simias concolor siberu</em></strong><strong> <br/> </strong>For the Siberut subspecies, more recent studies are available, estimating this primate to live in relatively undisturbed lowland rainforest on mineral soil at densities of ca. 53.1 individuals/km² (range: 38.8–72.5), representing values comparable to adjacent peat swamp forest (Peleonan Forest, North Siberut; Waltert <em>et al.</em> 2008 and Quinten<em> et al</em>. 2010). For Siberut National Park, which covers &gt;40 % of the island’s western side, surveys in 2011/12 yielded substantially lower density estimates: 8.5 (5.0-14.5) individuals/km²; on this basis, it was estimated that <em>ca</em> 14,112 (8,252-24,133) Pig-tailed Langurs still inhabit the park (Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2015). Previously, the total population on Siberut was estimated to comprise between 6,000-15,500 individuals (Whittaker 2006), however, the more recent estimates of Quinten <em>et al</em>.

Whittaker (2006) suggests the following conservation actions: ""1) increased protection for Siberut National Park, which currently lacks enforcement, 2) formal protection of the Peleonan forest in North Siberut, which is home to unusually high primate populations and is easily accessible, 3) protection of areas in the Pagai Islands by cooperating with a logging corporation that has practiced sustainable logging technique there since 1971, 4) conservation education, especially regarding hunting, and 5) the development of alternative economic models for the local people to reduce the likelihood of selling off their lands to logging companies.""<br/><br/>Quinten <em>et al</em>. (2014) further suggest (i) lobbying the local government to ban the use and possession of air rifles throughout the archipelago, and confiscate such weapons; (ii) an island-wide campaign to emphasize cultural tradition in order to increase the hunters’ inclination to follow traditional practices and taboos, including ceremonial rather than opportunistic hunting; (iii) improving agricultural practices to decrease dependence on primates for animal protein; (iv) active inclusion of locals into conservation projects and environmental tourism ventures on Siberut as guides and field assistants who can act as multipliers for a positive conservation message in their communities. </p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

In addition, habitat is being clear-cut to make way for agriculture in parts of the Northern Talapoin's range, especially where human population density is high. It is suspected that there has been a population decline in the order of 20–25% since 2005 and projected to 2029 (a 24-year period, i.e. three generations). Thus, the taxon almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A4cd.</p>","This species is typically associated with rivers and swamps, and uses swamp, flooded, riverine and secondary forests and old plantations (Gautier-Hion 2013) up to about 400m altitude. It is highly dependent on dense cover due to its small size and vulnerability to predation, and prefers very dense undergrowth typical of riverbanks. It seldom ascends to higher levels, except through foliage-covered liana tangles. It is never found more than 500 m from a watercourse, and can swim and dive under water if disturbed in overhanging vegetation. It often forages on the ground, and its diet is primarily composed of fruit, seeds and insects. Feeding on fruit is concentrated into an early morning bout, with another in late afternoon.

Insects form over one-third of the diet and half of that is made up of orthopterans.&#160;Beetles, caterpillars, ants and spiders are&#160;trapped throughout the day.&#160;Near villages, the Talapoin's diet may be dominated by cassava, especially when fruit is less available; the cassava tubers are taken from the village soaking streams and pools (tubers need to be soaked for several days to extract cyanide before people can eat them). Talapoins<em> </em>are also attracted to cultivated foods, such as bananas, paw-paw, maize and cucurbits, in riverside gardens.","The Northern Talapoin&#160;is not threatened, despite its vulnerability to predation and restricted range (perhaps due to the presence of a larger but close relative, Allen’s Swamp Monkey, which has similar habits). Indeed, densities of talapoins may double close to human settlements, with horticultural activity offering three main benefits: novel food sources are available, predators are&#160;deterred by human presence, and secondary growth flourishes with clearance and land rotation. Talapoins are&#160;not usually targeted by hunters, because they are small (weighing only 1–2 kg), so their meat is worth less than a shotgun cartridge (Oates 2011, Gautier-Hion 2013). This is changing with the decline of all other mammal species due to overhunting.","Historically, the Northern Talapoin&#160;was common in riverine and swamp forests, making them difficult to hunt; however, increasing hunting pressure is reducing their populations. In the 1960s, villages in Gabon used to have their “own” talapoin troop, which fed on cassava soaking in the rivers,&#160;but when the villages were revisited in the early 1980s, few of those troops remained (Gautier-Hion 2013). It is certain that similar declines have occurred elsewhere in&#160;its geographic range, especially in areas of high human population density.<br/><br/>Group size of animals not commensal with villages is 34–115 animals (mean 37 individuals); near human habitation, mean group size is larger (66 individuals) as these monkeys (Gautier-Hion 2013). They sleep at specific night-roosts, which are situated in dense vegetation near and usually over water where, if disturbed at night,&#160;they can drop into the water and swim away. Home ranges cover 100–500 ha, with densities of 40–90 animals per&#160;km².",Decreasing,"The Northern Talapoin occurs in the equatorial coastal forest zone from the source of the Sanaga River in central Cameroon to Angola (Cabinda), including Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and the extreme west of Congo. Its distribution is centred around the Ogooué River in Gabon, but its range spills over into the upper reaches of some Congo River tributaries, including the Dja, Mambili and Ngoko rivers. Surveys in Mbam Djerem National Park (Cameroon) in the mid-2000s (Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2006) and more recently (Yara and Ambahe 2017) confirmed the presence of the Northern Talapoin&#160;up to 6 degrees North in the transition zone between the Central African forest block and the Guinea-Congolia/Sudania savannas. It is likely that the species also occurs between Mbam Djerem&#160;and the more continuous forests further south.

This has resulted in habitat decline of up to almost 60% in the last decade (Supriatna and Mariati 2014). For <em>P. s. rhionis</em> in Bintan Island, approximately 70% of the land area had already been converted from forest to rubber gardens, industrial areas, tourist resorts and roads by the 1990s (Yanuar 1993/1994). Currently, land area on Bintan is still being converted to resorts and other tourist facilities.

It exists at a range of population densities and density appears to be highly habitat-specific. The Red Langur may be adaptable, as it is found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance. However, population densities above ~800 m asl may be so low as to be non-viable (Marshall 2010). Despite the species’ apparent habitat plasticity, the Red Langur is forest dependent, and is not known to readily use oil palm <span class=""None"">Elaeis guineensis<span class=""None""> plantations. The forests of Borneo are undergoing some of the world’s highest deforestation rates, largely as the result of the expansion of oil palm plantations, and thus such development and consequent loss of habitat, likely constitute the greatest threat to this species. Deforestation is largely occurring in the lowland regions where viable populations exist; remnant forests at elevations above ~800 m asl may not support viable populations, further exacerbating the conservation threat. Furthermore, much remnant habitat is under logging concession (mean 37% across all subspecies; Ehlers-Smith 2014a), which although may maintain as much forest cover as Protected Areas, the loggers may target the tallest trees with the greatest DBH, upon which Red Langurs are dependent for achieving their feeding (Ehlers Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013) and sleeping (Ehlers-Smith 2014b) requirements.</span><br/><br/>This species inhabits the same forests as <em>Hylobates albibarbis</em> and <em>H. muelleri</em> sp of gibbons, both of which are listed as Endangered.

Between 2000 and 2010 the species experienced a mean 10% habitat occupancy reduction across all subspecies; <em>P. r. chrysea</em> experienced a ~21% habitat occupancy reduction (Ehlers-Smith 2014a). Where the species persists there is hunting and collection for the wildlife trade and for human consumption. A large part of the species range is in peat swamp - an extremely threatened ecosystem. This species may qualify for Critically Endangered in the future if rates of habitat change increase, and thus should be carefully monitored. While currently unwarranted at the species level (overall <em>P. rubicunda</em> spp still occupy ~270,000 km2) <em>P. r. chysea</em> and <em>P. r. carimatae</em> are candidates for CR at this stage.<br/><br/>In addition, the effectiveness of the protected areas should be considered, as these areas seem to be strongholds for the species.

This species has a preference for primary forest but is found in degraded habitat as well. It has never been reported in oil palm plantations. It is also found in swamp forests (Chivers and Burton 1988), and evergreen forests (Davies and Oates 1994). It occasionally visits native gardens in search of food (Yanuar <em>et al</em>. 1993).

It may comprise folivory on young leaves (36%), seeds (30%), and combined frugivory on pulpy, seedy fruits and leaves (34%). This diet varies throughout the year as availability of food sources, particularly fruit, shifts (Davies 1991), and there is pronounced frugivory during fruiting periods (Hanya and Bernard 2012; Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Sabah, a group of <em>P. rubicunda</em> was found to rely on lianas for about 32% of their total diet; the rest were tree species and hemiepiphytes. In Central Kalimantan this species was found to have a very high level of granivory: mean annual diet comprised 76.4% seeds and 7.3% other fruit parts; 7.7% young and 2.5% mature leaves; 2.8% flowers; 2.6% piths, and &lt;1% on other minor food items (Ehlers-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013).

It predominantly occurs in primary forest areas, but also utilizes secondary rainforest, swamps and cultivated habitats (‘forest gardens’), albeit to a lesser extent. The species is known to use coconut groves as sleeping sites and move to primary forest in the morning to forage and feed. In previously logged forests, it was found to be most abundant in areas logged 20 years ago and least abundant in recently logged patches (Paciulli 2004). A diurnal as well as arboreal primate, it is known to use all levels of the forests; its most active time is spent in the middle canopy while it generally rests in the upper canopy—the ground is used only occasionally.<br/><br/>Being a colobine monkey, <em>P. potenziani </em>is highly folivorous, and feeds predominantly on leaves (55% of diet); it is one of the few primates that eats the leaves of dipterocarp trees. In addition, this langur eats fruits and seeds (32%) or flowers, bark, sap (13%) and fungi (Fuentes, 1996). However, its diet can apparently vary with habitat: a study conducted in a secondary forest recorded fruits and seeds to constitute up to 70% of the diet. A large proportion of its diet, up to 35%, consists of ""climber"" type vegetation.<br/><br/>The Mentawai langur is known to live in groups of 2–6 individuals with variable social organization (unimale-unifemale, unimale-multifemale, multimale-multifemale), and uses home range sizes of between 11 – 40 ha (Fuentes 1996; Sangchantr 2004); typically, a single infant is born around July-August. </span></p>","<p>This species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging, as well as conversion to oil palm plantations, forest clearing, and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). Hunting pressure has increased in recent years as a result of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Furthermore, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been progressively eroded due to missionary and state influences. The pet trade constitutes a minor threat to this species (Whittaker 2006). It is known as the second most popular game species after the Pig-tailed Langur. The Mentawai Langur might be confronting hunting threats like its sister taxa in the Siberut Islands wherein hunters are suspected to kill langurs in their sleeping trees. </p>","<p>Based on the most recent estimate of <em>Presbytis potenziani</em> density from the Pagai Islands—about 1 to 4 individuals/km² (Paciulli 2004)—Whittaker (2006) estimated that probably only 300–1,200 individuals remain throughout this species' entire range. However, the animals may have adapted to hunting by becoming cryptic, causing these population estimates to be on the low end (Whittaker 2006). For instance, Fuentes (1994) reports encountering 10 groups within 1.36 km² and Sangchantr (2004) observed four groups within a 50 ha study site (both in North Pagai). This suggests an actual density higher than that observed by Paciulli (2004).

While a researcher initially succeeded in gaining protected status from the government for the so-called “Betumonga Research Area” in North Pagai (late 1990s), local people sold this forest to a logging company after the researchers work was concluded in 2002. Consequently<em> P. potenziani </em>is currently not found in any protected area; there are also no specimens in captivity. With regard to conservation actions, the following was recommended by Whittaker (2006): the protection of areas in the Pagai Islands by cooperating with a logging corporation that has practiced sustainable logging there since 1971, conservation education, especially regarding hunting, and the development of alternative economic models for the local people to reduce the likelihood of selling off their lands to logging companies.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

These monkeys are also hunted for food and to deter crop raiding (Nijman 2004).<br/><br/>They are relatively tolerant of forest disturbance and light logging but forest destruction and hunting are ongoing threats. In 2010, the forest loss was estimated to be more than 50% due to settlements and primarily monoculture plantations for wood pulp and palm oil. The dry forest floors due to the intensive, selective logging during El Niño years result in forest fires, which are considerably problematic. Only about 50,000 km² of forests remain. Oil fields, between Sarawak and Brunei, hunting for bezoar stones and crop raid deterring, inland settlements and timber industries (both correlate with the langur’s hunting).

Thus, the total decline between 1999 and 2019&#160;is estimated at ~40% of the population. In addition, more than 30% of the remaining habitat has been attributed to logging concessions. With population reduction and habitat loss continuing into the foreseeable future, it is suspected that the population decline over a period of 30 years (three generations for this taxon) will exceed 50%. This species does not occur in any protected areas and commercial hunting affects all portions of its range, with no evidence that effective controls are likely in the near future.</p>","A semi-terrestrial species with group sizes averaging about 15 (Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. 1999). <em>Cercocebus chrysogaster</em> occurs in seasonally-inundated lowland and upland rainforest and may occur in gallery forest (Gautier-Hion <em>et al.</em> 1999); occasionally ranges into secondary forest. Inogwabini and Thompson (2013) estimate that 58% of the range of the western population is swamp forest. In the Lusambo district (eastern population), the species occurs on white sand <em>terra firma</em> forests in areas where swamps are uncommon (Hart unpublished data 2010). Colyn and Deleporte (2006) classify <em>C. chrysogaster</em> as a riparian taxon capable of swimming.<p>Beaune&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2012) reported&#160;<em>C. chrysogaster</em>&#160;as a seed-dispersing species in the Lui Kotal forest.</p>","<p>High numbers of <em>Cercocebus chrysogaster</em> are killed for the commercial bushmeat trade across their range. This has led to ongoing dramatic population declines. The species appears to be highly vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>In the western population, Inogwabini and Thompson (2013) report that <em>C. chrysogaster</em> represents 30–70% of bushmeat available in some markets, including a major market at Oshwe, located near a military post at Bungimba. Beaune <em>et al</em>. (2012) report that populations in the Lui Kotal area are hunted and declining. Thompson (unpublished data 2008) documented a hunt on an island in the Momboyo River, created by a seasonal inundation, where numerous animals were systematically hunted down in a confined area.<br/><br/>In the eastern population, market surveys in Lusambo in 2010, revealed numerous fresh carcasses of <em>C chrysogaster</em>, representing about 10% of all bushmeat recorded (Thompson and Hart 2015). These animals came from the forest between the Sankuru and Lubefu rivers (Kapula Block). The presence of high numbers of fresh carcasses suggested that entire groups were being slaughtered in single events. A follow-up enquiry in Lusambo in 2015 confirmed that hunting of <em>C. chrysogaster</em> continues, but that fresh carcasses are now uncommon and populations of <em>C. chrysogaster</em> are reported to be low.<br/><br/>In 2012, 16 of 20 villages (80%) surveyed reported declines in the occurrence of the species due to hunting during the preceding decades, especially following a period of civil conflict (1998–2005; Hart unpubl. data 2015); 5 villages (25%) reported extirpation of the species from their locality (reported as uncommon, difficult to find, or only located far away). Furthermore, during 6 weeks of field surveys in 2012, field teams recorded 10 fresh carcasses, and three cases of mass killings (4–10 animals). Hunting for the species was still reported ongoing, even in villages reporting the declines.<br/><br/>The species is also threatened by habitat loss due to logging, leading to declines in range area and range occupancy. Inogwabini <em>et al</em>. (2013) report that west of the Lake Mai-Ndombe, where the species no longer occurs, local communities reported its disappearance over the course of two decades following the arrival of intensive logging. Industrial-scale logging concessions have been delimited in about 30% of the species’ range. Additional smaller-scale logging operations are widespread in the western range (Ministry of Environment 2013), thus the proportion of the species' range vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation is likely higher.<br/><br/>Captive animals are seen frequently in both the western and eastern locations, and for sale on the streets in Kinshasa (Inogwabini and Thompson 2013). Between 1983 and 2002, CITES records report exports of 43 animals identified as <em>Cercocebus</em> spp. originating from DRC. Lack of CITES export records since 2002 is likely due to inadequate record keeping, rather than elimination of the trade. Nevertheless, declining visibility of <em>C. chrysogaster</em> offered for sale publicly in Kinshasa over the last several years (Hart unpublished observations 2015) might be a result of increasing rarity of the species due to unsustainable offtake.<br/><br/><em>Cercocebus chrysogaster&#160;</em>is persecuted as an agricultural pest in some areas (Inogwabini and Thompson 2013).</p>","<p>The species occurs in two widely-separated populations (Thompson and Hart 2015).

A decline of 55% has also been recorded for the eastern population. Hunting pressure continues to be high and 30% of remaining range is attributed to logging concessions.

Inogwabini and Thompson (2013) confirm that the two blocks, one in the northwest and one in the southeast, are separated by an area of non-occupation beginning east of 20°30’ longitude and extending to the Sankuru River north of Lusambo. In the southeast, the species occurs between the Sankuru and Lubefu Rivers, but not on the west bank of the Sankuru (Thompson and Hart 2015). As suggested by Hill (1974), there is no evidence that the species ranges east to Lomami River. The eastern limit appears to be Lubefu River.

Population reduction is expected to continue, based on a continuing decline in its area of occupancy and extent of occurrence, as a result of the current high rate of habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due to unsustainable exploitation of forest, woodland, and bushland by people. A future population reduction exceeding 80% over three generations (33 years) is predicted, given the rate of decline in forest cover levels reached in recent years. This is especially likely if the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR) is officially annulled, an action now being considered by national authorities. The entire population lies in a politically insecure area over which there is a low level of conservation activity, and much unplanned, unregulated, and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources.</p>","<em>Cercocebus galeritus </em>is restricted to flood-plain forest, riverine gallery forest, and the adjacent woodland and bushland (Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013). Abundance is highly correlated with the spatial characteristics of the forests (Wahungu <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is a semi-terrestrial monkey that can travel up to 1 km through non-forested habitat between forest patches (Wieczkowski 2010). Mean group size is <em>ca </em>27 individuals (range: 6–62; Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013).<em> Cercocebus galeritus </em>is frugivorous and forages predominantly on the ground and up to 2 m above the ground (Homewood 1978). It feeds on seeds, fruits, stems, leaves, insects and fungi (Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013).","<em>Cercocebus galeritus </em>has declined as a result of several causes including: (a) drastic changes in vegetation due to dam construction, irrigation projects and water diversion, which affect both the water table and the frequency and severity of flooding which, in turn, affect the extent and quality of this species’ forest habitat; (b) forest clearance for agriculture; (c) fires that destroy forests; (d) habitat degradation due to livestock and (e) the unsustainable collection of wood and other forest products; (f) selective felling of fig trees for canoes; (g) exploitation of one of the species’ top food plants,<em> Phoenix reclinata</em>; and (h) corruption, inter-ethnic violence and insecurity. There is also percution of <em>C. galeritus </em>as a crop pest and this is expected to increase as natural foods become less available due to habitat loss (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Mbora 2000, de Jong and Butynski 2012, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013, Butynski and Hamerlynck 2016, Butynski and de Jong 2019). Because all remaining forests inhabited by<em> C. galeritus </em>are small and seriously threatened, the long-term survival of the species is in question.<br/><br/>There has been considerable alteration of river flow volume and the flood cycle by five hydroelectric power dams up-river (Butynski 1995). A sixth dam, the High Grand Falls Dam, is under construction (Hamerlynck <em>et al.</em> 2012; Butynski and Hamerlynck 2016). The High Grand Falls Dam, the second largest dam in Africa, will be accompanied by large-scale irrigation schemes and water transfer to the ‘Lamu Port and Lamu Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor’. The establishment of this dam is expected to have additional negative impacts on the forests of the Lower Tana River and, therefore, on<em> C. galeritus.<br/></em><em></em><br/>One special concern is the rapidly growing human population in the region. Another is the possible annulment of the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR; 169 km²), which the High Court of Kenya ordered in January 2007. According to the Kenya Wildlife Act 2013, Section 37, change of boundaries or revocation of a National Reserve can only be published by the Cabinet Secretary and approved by Parliament. Change or revocation can only be recommended if they do not endanger any species or critical habitat. As such, it seems unlikely that annulment will occur despite the court ruling in 2007.<em><br/></em><br/><em></em><em></em>About 56% of<em> C. galeritus </em>occur in TRPNR. Even with the continued existence of the TRPNR the long-term survival of<em> C. galeritus </em>is not certain as the high level of insecurity and inadequate law enforcement in the region is expected to continue, as is the growth in the human population (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Mbora 2000, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, Butynski and de Jong 2019).","<em></em>  <p><em>Cercocebus galeritus</em> is often relatively common where present (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013).

It is an extremely adaptable species that can also live in rural and urban environments. When in woodland or forest areas, the species seems to prefer living near the edge; trees and shrubs provide shelter and sleeping sites while nearby open areas provide ample opportunity for ground foraging (Ansell 1978 in Sarmiento 2013). Most of its range is dry and warm, with temperatures of 18–24°C throughout the year.

Invertebrates and some small vertebrates (e.g., fledglings and lizards) are also eaten, but detailed dietary data are not available.","Like other members of this genus, the Malbrouck monkey is a skilled crop-raider. Consequently, it is hunted as a pest in some parts of its range (Angola and Zambia, Sarmiento 2013). Poaching for bushmeat is widespread in Angola, yet very few Malbrouck monkeys are found on display in markets. Instead, antelopes and forest primate species (e.g., blue monkey and red-tailed monkeys) are targeted by hunters (P. Pinto pers. comm. 2016). Occasionally, young monkeys of the species are sold alive as pets. The apparently low poaching factor, combined with the adaptability of the species and its ranging in areas with low incidence of human-wildlife conflict, suggest that there are no known major threats at this time.","No data on population density exist for this species.

Where not hunted, they become habituated to humans and have been observed to take handouts from tourists.<br/><br/>An omnivorous species, Grivets are especially fond of figs and other fruiting trees and, in some areas, they are heavily dependent on parts of thorn trees (<em>Acacia</em>, Fabaceae), including seeds, thorns and bark (Butynski 2002). They’re known to occasionally eat bird's eggs and animal prey, including invertebrates, chameleons, fledgling birds and small mammals, such as rodents and even galagos (Galagidae).<br/><br/>Grivet Monkeys live in bands of 6–20, averaging a dozen individuals (Dorst and Dandelot 1972). As with other taxa in this genus, males transfer between groups, while females tend to remain in their natal groups. This diurnal and mostly terrestrial species has a complex social structure; most groups have multiple adult males that are usually outnumbered by adult females (Wallis 2013). Individuals may live for more than 30 years. A single offspring is born after a gestation period of approximately 6 months.","<em>Chlorocebus aethiops</em> is generally common and adaptable over its range. Although Grivet Monkeys have a long list of likely nonhuman predators, many of these species’ numbers have declined in recent years. Thus, for the Grivet, there are presumed to be no major predatory threats. Their affinity for crop-raiding may result in human-wildlife conflict that could impact their numbers in some locales as pests are killed, but hunting grivets for meat by local humans is not widely reported.<br/><br/>As in other areas of Africa, large-scale farming and expansion of human habitations clearly plays a role in reducing suitable habitat. Furthermore, Zinner <em>et al. </em>(2002) noted that the influx of refugees from Ethiopia and Sudan into Eritrea exacerbated loss of habitat and escalated human-wildlife conflict.<br/><br/>Additionally, genetic analyses of Grivet Monkey&#160;populations living in a large geographic area along the Awash River (Ethiopia) found a low level of variability compared with many other cercopithecines (Shimada and Shotake 1997). Turner (1981) found similar lack of diversity in a blood protein study of Ethiopian grivets. These findings are explained as a likely consequence of recent and repeated series of rapid habitat expansions following dramatic climate conditions as suggested by paleoclimatic data (Shimada and Shotake 1997). If so, Grivet Monkeys&#160;may be one of many primate species facing challenges due to climate change. Further studies are therefore recommended.","This is a common species, though not well-studied. Thus, reliable recent population numbers for most of its range are not available. The current population trend of “stable” requires more data for further assessment.&#160;Grivet Monkeys are the most widespread monkey species in Ethiopia; Dunbar and Dunbar (1974) recorded their density in the Bole Valley at 73 individuals per&#160;km²&#160;and the biomass was estimated at 207 kg/km².

Its range formerly extended along the Nile Valley. It is suspected that the species may have once ranged as far north as southern Egypt, but no records have confirmed their presence. Thus, the northern limit of the Grivet Monkey's range is thought to be approximately 15°N, which is likely the northernmost limit of any guenon species (Butynski and Kingdon 2013).<br/><br/><em>Chlorocebus aethiops</em> intergrades with <em>C. pygerythrus</em> in southwestern Ethiopia; it is unclear whether the resulting hybrids are the form originally described as <em>C. a. zavattarii</em>.

There is continuing decline of the population and the number of mature individuals due to ongoing habitat loss and degradation, hunting and, perhaps, hybridisation. The species occurs at low densities in bamboo forest as well as in fragmented forests. <em>C. djamdjamensis</em> occupies a specialised niche with unusual habitat and diet (reviewed in Butynski<em> et al. </em>2013, Mekonnen and Jaffe 2016).","<em>Chlorocebus djamdjamensis</em> has specialised habitat requirements, as it is found in the bamboo forest zone of the Bale Mountains and Sidamo Highlands. <em>C. djamdjamensis </em>is unique among <em>Chlorocebus </em>species, with its specialised niche including habitat (bamboo forest), diet (bamboo young leaves and shoots) and high altitudinal range (inhabiting higher altitudes in a narrow geographic range). Mekonnen <em>et al. </em>(2010a, 2010b, 2012, 2016) and Butynski <em>et al.</em> (2013) summarise the current state of knowledge of this diurnal, semi-terrestrial monkey.","The main threats to Bale Monkeys are ongoing habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, hunting and, perhaps, hybridization. For example, the Harenna Forest, where <em>Chlorocebus djamdjamensis</em> is generally uncommon, it is under threat from expanding human populations, fire, agriculture and the removal of forest products such as bamboo, lumber, fuelwood and charcoal. Threatened with extirpation in the Sidamo Highlands due to habitat loss and fragmentation that leave many populations in small, isolated, forest fragments in the human-dominated landscape. Two populations extirpated in southern Ethiopia (e.g. Abera; Mekonnen <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>The species is persecuted for crop raiding at some locations. People report intense conflict with <em>C. djamdjamensis</em> and hunt this species with traps, spears and dogs (Mekonnen <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>Recent morphological and genetic studies suggest hybridization between <em>C. djamdjamensis </em>and&#160;<em>Chlorocebus aethiops</em> on the margins of their ranges (e.g., Ekuma Mountain, Kulla Mountain, and Wotiye; Mekonnen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Haus <em>et al.</em> 2013).

Increasing hunting pressure for bushmeat and persecution as crop pests in many parts of their range are suspected to be causing a population decline. Habitat loss caused by mining, agriculture and human population growth is also a threat, but the total decline has not exceeded 30% over the past three generations (36 years).</p>","<p><em>C. sabaeus</em> occurs in riverine gallery woodlands, acacia savannas, Sahel savannas, Guinea savannas, savanna-forest mosaic, mangrove forest and at the edge of lowland tropical moist forest (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013). Temperature range is 1–57°C (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977).</p>  <p>Home ranges sizes are variable. For instance, in Saloum, Senegal, home range was reported as 138 ha (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976). In the Senegal River valley, home ranges are 157–164 ha (Galat 1983). Day range length is 2,000–8,000 m. In the Bandia Reserve, Senegal, day range can reach up to 11,000 m during the dry season, when the monkeys are searching for water (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). <em>C. sabaeus</em> is diurnal, semi-terrestrial and spends 28–61% of its time on the ground; 20–80% at 0–5 m height; 12–20% at 5–10 m; 2–8% at 10–20 m. On rare occasions, it climbs above 20 m, for example in <em>Dialium guineense</em> in Burkina Faso (Galat-Luong 1976, Galat 1983, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). Green monkeys swim readily (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976, Oates 2011, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p><em>C. sabaeus</em> occurs in multi-male/multi-female groups. In Senegal, troop size varies from 8 to 174, and large troops fission into one-male subgroups during the rainy and birth seasons (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977, Galat 1983). In Côte d’Ivoire, group size varies from 4 to 9 individuals (Galat and Galat-Luong 1980). Females of different troops guard offspring in common nurseries in large trees during daytime rest periods (Galat and Galat-Luong 2013).</p>  <p><em>C. sabaeus</em> is an opportunistic generalist omnivore (Galat <em>et al</em>. 2009). They feed on fruits (24–50%), leaves (28–50%), seeds (13%), flowers (3–13%), buds, young twigs, stems, bark and gum (11–15%), invertebrates (5–50%) and vertebrates, including birds’ eggs, birds, lizards and small mammals. Unusual food items include <em>Acacia seyal</em> thorns, fungi, bird faeces, and soil from termite mounds (Galat and Galat-Luong 1977, 1978, McGrew <em>et al</em>. 1978, Galat 1983, Harrison 1983). In the Senegal River valley, <em>C. sabaeus</em> were observed to prey upon <em>Arvicanthis niloticus</em>,<em> Streptopelia senegalensis</em>,<em> Passer griseus</em>,<em> Tockus erythrorhynchus</em>, eggs, <em>Lepus saxatilis</em>, lizards. They also dug out West African marbled lungfishes <em>Protopterus</em> <em>annectens</em> from their subterranean borrows during the dry season (Galat-Luong 1977, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Saloum mangrove, they feed on <em>Rhizophora mangle</em> aerial roots and prey upon fiddler crabs <em>Uca tangeri</em> (Galat and Galat-Luong 1976). In some locations, they crop raid and steal food from tourists (Galat 1983, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013).&#160;</p>  <p>Territorial behaviour is related to habitat productivity and food availability. At sites with more than 500 mm annual rainfall, <em>C. sabaeus</em> occupies relatively small home ranges because productivity is sufficient to sustain a group in a small area. In rich environments, <em>C. sabaeus</em> live in small groups (less than 36 individual) in small home ranges (15–30 ha, with some local exceptions in less diverse habitats, such as plantations). In such conditions, a dominant male defends an exclusive territory using ritualized territorial displays. In habitats with less than 500 mm annual rainfall, food supply becomes more restricted because of low productivity and low predictability. In such poor environments, <em>C. sabaeus</em> lives in larger groups (up to 174 individuals) and has large home ranges (up to 140 ha). These home ranges are widely overlapping among groups without any territorial behaviour. Up to 300 individuals of different troops have been seen to share a large local food source simultaneously without showing any overt aggression. In smaller food patches, Galat and colleagues observed a form of queuing by subgroups (Galat 1983, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013, Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;</p><p><em>C. sabaeus</em> prefers to sleep in large tall trees with good visibility of surroundings, along riverbanks when available (Galat-Luong <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Senegal River valley, different troops may share the same sleeping trees (Galat 1983).</p><p>The natural predators of <em>C. sabaeus</em> are <em>Panthera pardus, Python sebae, Crocuta crocuta, Lycaon pictus, Pan troglodytes</em> and large eagles. <em>Caracal caracal</em>, Leptailurus serval,&#160;<em>Lupulella</em><em>&#160;adustus, Canis lupus familiaris</em> probably also prey on young green monkeys (Pruetz and Bertolani 2007, Galat and Galat-Luong 2013).

Prevalence can reach 46% in wild populations (Galat and Galat-Luong 1997).</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Humans are major predators – <em>C. sabaeus</em> are hunted as bushmeat and killed to protect crops. Increasing hunting pressure and bushmeat traffic is affecting populations in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and Sierra Leone (Ginn and Nekaris 2014, Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015). Green monkeys emit territorial loud calls at dawn and sunset, indicating the location of the whole troop (often a single large tree). This makes them easy to hunt; however, as hunting pressure increases and <em>C. sabaeus</em> density decreases, they adapt their behaviour and become quiet while dispersing into several trees, sometimes with as few as one monkey per tree. As a result, hunting becomes more difficult (A. Galat-Luong and G. Galat pers. obs. 1974–1976, 1988–2002).</p><p>There is evidence of increasing live trade as pets. In addition, they are persecuted as crop pests in many parts of their range (Wallis 2013). An exception is in Mali, where this threat is low according to Schleicher <em>et al</em>.

They often show a preference for gallery forest (Nakagawa 1999), but they are found in dry woodlands in northern Nigeria, and montane forests in southern Nigeria.</p>  <p>This species is extremely adaptable, residing in degraded habitats or forest edges (e.g., in Togo and Bénin; Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008), and is found in both rural and urban environments (Wallis 2013). It lives sympatrically with Patas Monkeys (<em>Erythrocebus patas</em>) in much of their range (Nakagawa 1999, 2000).&#160;</p>  <p>As with other members of their genus, Tantalus Monkeys have an omnivorous diet, feeding on leaves, fruits, seeds, flowers, gums, birds’ eggs, invertebrates (including insects), and some small vertebrates (Nakagawa 2000). They spend 20–25% of their time feeding, but this varies by season and location of study (Nakagawa 1999).</p>  <p>Although they can feed high in the trees, much of their feeding takes place on or near the ground (Kavanagh 1978). In fact, Tantalus Monkeys are largely terrestrial and can travel long distances while foraging of approximately 2,500 m per day (Nakagawa 1999). They are key seed dispersers, playing an important role in forest regeneration of their habitats; some disperse seeds as far as 1–5 km from the parent tree (Agmen <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>","<p><em>Chlorocebus tantalus</em> is common and highly adaptable over its range. There are presumed to be no major predatory threats. As with others in their genus, the Tantalus Monkey’s affinity for crop-raiding can result in frequent human-wildlife conflict, which impacts their numbers in some locations. However, because they often live near Patas Monkeys or Olive Baboons (<em>Papio anubis</em>), both of which are larger and bolder in their crop-raiding efforts, the Tantalus Monkey may often escape blame (and persecution). As mentioned, hunting Tantalus Monkeys for their meat by humans is not widely reported, perhaps due to their relatively small size, although Hema et al. (2019) found the species for sale as part of their bushmeat survey in Burkina Faso.&#160;</p>  <p>Occasionally, these monkeys become ensnared by traps set for other wildlife in their habitat or struck by vehicles on roads (Wallis pers. obs. 2009 in Uganda).&#160;</p>  <p>With widespread habitat depletion and forecasts for dramatic ecosystem responses to climate conditions reported for parts of Africa (e.g., Ponce-Reyes <em>et al</em>. 2017), the Tantalus Monkey may eventually face increasing challenges due to climate change. Thus, their numbers should be monitored, and further study of their distribution is recommended.</p>","<p><em>C. tantalus</em> is a common species, widely distributed in various habitat types. Alhough very few population density estimates are available, some recent reports from interviews and surveys indicate a decreasing population when compared with historical accounts (Ginn and Nekaris 2014). In some locations, they may be at risk due to human-wildlife conflict caused by crop-raiding (Wallis pers. obs. 2005–2009 in Nigeria, 2009 in Uganda). Overall, however, the population appears to be stable and may even be increasing in some areas where forest clearance provides more suitable habitat (see Habitats and Ecology section).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Tantalus Monkey occurs widely across Africa. It ranges from eastern Burkina Faso and east of the Volta River system in Ghana (recorded from Accra Plain and Salaga) eastward to Sudan (Imatong Mountains in the south to Jebel Marra in the north), South Sudan, and much of Uganda. They have been recorded up to about 1,900 m asl.&#160;</p>  <p>The three subspecies range as follows: <em>C. t. tantalus</em> Ogilby, 1841 – from eastern Burkina Faso and Ghana (east of the Volta River) through Central African Republic, Chad and into northwestern DR Congo; <em>C. t. budgetti</em> Pocock, 1907 – northeastern DR Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, and Uganda; and <em>C. t. marrensis</em> Thomas and Hinton, 1923, found in western Sudan (west of the White Nile), and in South Sudan from the Imatong Mountains in the south to Jebel Marra in the north, where it is isolated from other populations by desert.</p>  <p>Previous assessments have placed this species in northwest Kenya, but more recent surveys suggest the <em>Chlorocebus</em> monkeys in that area are <em>C. pygerythrus</em> instead (Butynski and de Jong 2017). It should be noted that the taxonomic status of the species and subspecies of <em>Chlorocebus</em> is complex and needs further phenotypic study. Butynski and de Jong (2017) report that <em>C. tantalus, C. aethiops </em>and<em> C. pygerythrus</em> occur in extensive phenotypic clines in parts of northwest Kenya and northeast Uganda. There appear to be no effective geographic barriers between these species.</p>","<p>                   </p><p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><span lang=""EN-US"">Hunting Tantalus Monkeys for their meat is not widely reported, perhaps due to their relatively small size, although Hema <em>et al</em>.

Still, their semi-terrestrial and gregarious nature often places them in conflict with humans.

In Cambodia, it is found in a wide variety of primarily lowland habitats, including evergreen and semi-evergreen forest patches within the extensive deciduous dipterocarp forests, mixed deciduous patches, riparian strips, gallery forest (Kong and Tan 2002, Moody <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011), and the seasonally inundated forests of&#160; the Tonle Sap Lake&#160; and Mekong floodplains (Davidson 2006). The upper altitudinal limit is not clear, but there are no known records in Cambodia above 450 m (Moody <em>et al</em>. 2011).

In Lao PDR, it is probably localized though possibly common in a few areas; however, no large continuous area is known to support high populations (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). The Indochinese silvered langur is probably the rarest and most threatened monkey in Lao PDR (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Thailand the taxon is moderately common in several protected areas, but has declined significantly (W. Brockelmann pers. comm). <br/><br/><em>Trachypithecus germaini </em>is known only from a few small isolated populations in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam (Nadler <em>et al. 2003</em>). The largest confirmed population in Viet Nam is at least 223 individuals found in Kien Luong Karst Area of Kien Luong Province (Hoang Minh Duc <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Another potentially viable population in Viet Nam is confirmed on Phu Quoc Island with estimated 31-44 individuals (Le Khac Quyet and Nguyen Vu Khoi 2010).

They thrive in such habitats where caves and crevices offer warm shelter during cold winters. They mostly occur in lower elevations of <em>ca</em> 500 m up to 1,000 m asl in Pu Luong Nature Reserve. <br/><br/>Leaves make up most of the diet (80%) therefore they are primarily folivorous, of which 60% constitutes young leaves and 20% mature leaves.

Only the subpopulation at Van Long, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behavior of the animals (Nadler 2004, 2014). The smallest populations are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as the species occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas.","<p><span class=""None"">Surveys carried out between 1990 and 2000 resulted in the discovery of 19 subpopulations in a restricted area of northern Viet Nam. Taken from these surveys the total of all populations was estimated at 49-53 groups and 270-302 individuals. In three areas where Delacour’s langur occurred in the past the species was already eradicated by the 1990s, following information provided by local people (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). About half of all discovered populations (10) occurred in unprotected areas. The protection level in protected areas is mostly low, but still under control of the Forest Protection Department. In unprotected areas there is no control over hunting, and the animals are under high pressure.<br/><br/>With additional surveys in the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century the total number of recorded individuals increased slightly. The number of groups is 50-57 and the number of individuals 281-317. The increased total number of langurs resulted in the development of the population in Van Long Nature Reserve, the area under special protection through the Vietnam Primate Conservation Program of Frankfurt Zoological Society, which included additional education and awareness programs for the surrounding communes of the area. The distribution of animals within subpopulations during this period indicates a reduction in the occurrence of larger populations compared to the previous decade (Nadler 2004; 2015). During this decade a number of small populations were eradicated. The exact years of extirpation cannot be verified. The information is based on interview surveys of local villagers, who indicated that the last sighting or record of the species was often several years ago. Therefore, these small populations are believed to be eradicated.<br/><br/>Surveys were carried out between 2012 and 2015 by the Endangered Primate Rescue Center and Forestry University Hanoi to verify the current situation of the species. The results of the surveys in all known subpopulations shows a dramatic decline compared to the last decade. The total number is estimated at 234-275 individuals. The majority occurs in Van Long Nature Reserve and if the population of the nature reserve is combined with the adjacent planned extension area to count as one population, the total for the area is 164-191 individuals. The remaining 70-84 individuals occur in the additional seven areas. Not one of these populations has a size which can guarantee a secure future, even if hunting could be eliminated. The problem of inbreeding for these small populations is not relevant. Before the inbreeding coefficient increases over a certain level, the populations will be extinct through other pressures.<span class=""None""><br/><br/>The results of the surveys clearly illustrate the dire situation for the species and the extreme value of Van Long Nature Reserve as the last and only refuge for the survival of the species.</span></p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Viet Nam and occurs in a very restricted area of north-central Viet Nam that totals about 5,000 km². The distribution of subpopulations and smaller social groups is closely related to the series of limestone mountain ranges in the provinces of Ninh Binh, Nam Ha, Hoa Binh, and Thanh Hoa (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2004, 2015; Nadler and Brockman 2014). The area of occupancy (AOO) for this species prior to 2000 was only about 400 km² but with eradication of several populations the AOO is currently smaller than 300 km² (Nadler 2015).","The species is hunted primarily for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"", but also for food and occasionally for the pet trade.",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""None"">This species is currently listed in CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'critically endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed under the highest protection level in Decree 32/2006, and as species for special conservation considerations in Decree 160/2013. It occurs in six protected areas. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for conservation of this species in 2001, and there has been evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past 15 years.<br/><br/>The primary focus of conservation activities for the species should be the protection of all remaining populations. But this is far from the reality. The protection of areas without current protection status - which are three areas - is not feasible. To apply for a protection status and establish strong protection for an area is not a viable option for such extremely small populations with little chance of ever developing into viable populations. These populations will be eradicated and disappear in the near future. The most efficient option to stabilize the largest existing population in Van Long Nature reserve and to save sufficient habitat for the long-term existence of a viable population would be the extension of the reserve. <br/><br/>Translocation of isolated groups of animals or small populations from areas under pressure or for improving the genetic pool of a larger population is undoubtedly an important conservation tool for many species. The most critical point is the method with which to catch the animals in the areas which are often very difficult to access. One way is netting of the animals in a cave, a sleeping place which the animals occasionally or preferentially use in the winter season. Special caves and cracks in the limestone outcrops are often used consistently by generations of animals in one group. But groups which use easily accessible caves are as a consequence of easy access, are already wiped out by hunters and the remaining sleeping places are very difficult to access. Currently, there is no other proven technique for capturing animals in the difficult terrain that constitutes their natural habitat. A well-trained team with substantial financial and technical support would be necessary to develop a technique to safely capture animals in the wild.<br/><br/>A basis for reintroduction is the captive population of Delacour’s langur at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center. In 2011 a first pilot project was conducted with the reintroduction of three captive born individuals into Van Long Nature Reserve (Agmen 2014, Nadler 2012). Based on the successful result a second reintroduction took place in November 2012, also in Van Long Nature Reserve (Elser 2013, Elser <em>et al.</em> 2015). The programs have been very positively received by villagers and the awareness about protection of the species in the communes surrounding the nature reserve is very high.

Therefore, a comprehensive conservation awareness program was added to the research initiative. This program included a schools lecture and nature walk initiative to promote conservation awareness among the next generation of environmental stewards. It also included vocational training programs for adults to improve their opportunities for employment and income generation. The needs of community elders were addressed as well, through a health clinics initiative that provided medicines for old age problems like diabetes, hypertension, arthritis and spectacles and free cataract surgery for seniors with visual impairments. The success of this program led to its replication at a locality within the range of <span class=""MsoPageNumber""><em>S. v. monticola</em><span class=""MsoPageNumber""> where a reforestation project and initiatives to prevent firewood extraction from natural habitats were also underway. While conservation actions during the past six years were limited to two areas, several newspaper articles were published to promote conservation awareness throughout the country. <br/><br/>Future conservation actions will include field surveys of the known ranges of all four subspecies with the objective of identifying two or more sites within each range that could be developed as protected areas. The above-mentioned activities will then be launched in nearby communities, and people will also be trained in protected area administration and management, nature guiding and interpretation, small business management and other vocations that help to promote the sustainable use of their protected area under the supervision of the government’s Department of Wildlife Conservation. Efforts to mitigate human-monkey conflicts with active participation of local communities will also be an important component of future conservation actions.<br/><br/>Active participation of local communities in managing and deriving sustainable benefits from natural habitats is a new concept in Sri Lanka. It was presented and discussed during two workshops where it received favourable responses from government authorities and non-governmental organizations. Therefore, this idea has been incorporated into a Conservation Action Plan for all Sri Lankan monkey species that is currently being developed according to IUCN guidelines. When this Action Plan is completed it will be submitted to the Sri Lankan government and the IUCN for approval.<br/><br/>While a sensible conservation action plan has been developed its implementation will depend a great deal on political will, financial support and many unknowns about people and their environment. Therefore, even with unfettered financial and political support it may take several years to bring this action plan to fruition. However, a start has been made with the hope that the threat of endangerment and extinction of the Purple-faced Langur will be eliminated as soon as possible.<span class=""MsoPageNumber""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

In Vietnam Ha Tinh Langurs are usually found in limestone areas with dense forest cover such as the habitat in Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park. They prefer caves and cliffs as sleeping sites, locations that are thought to provide protection from predators (including humans). According to Nadler (2013) cliffs that are used as sleeping sites range from 20 to 60 m in height and specific sleeping sites can sometimes be identified by dark yellow and brown marks that occur directly below cause by urine and feces of the resting Langurs.

Snaring is reported to be the predominant hunting method in Phong Nha-Ke Bang (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999), with an increase since 1996 (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). Hunting with rifles has appeared to diminish since 1995, probably due to gun legislation controls, confiscation of guns by local authorities, and a decrease of hunting success (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). Road construction around Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park has increased hunting and illegal logging (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). Habitat loss is also a problem in some areas (Nguyen Manh Ha 2006).

Like other Langurs, this species is mainly folivorous, with leaves making up between 75-87% of its diet; the rest is composed of fruit, flowers, and stems (Hendershott <em>et al.,</em>&#160;in prep.).

Reproductively valuable males were often the most common victims due to their behavior (Stenke and Chu Xuan Canh, 2004).&#160;This is highly questionable, however,&#160;as their behaviour is not enormously different and, if anything, females would be easier to hunt as they are often grouped together and there are more of them per group (Leonard Neahga in litt., 31 October 2019).<br/><br/>Hunting for meat seems to have happened rarely due to the reputed poor taste of langur meat.<br/><br/>Habitat disturbance and fragmentation resulting from the growing human population on Cat Ba Island (due in large part to the country's designation of the island as a new tourism center for northern Viet Nam), and rampant fires due to honey collectors (Nadler and Long, 2000) are also threats.<br/><br/>Poorly regulated tourism in the inadequately managed Cat Ba National Park has direct effects on langur natural history, such as the disturbance to habitat in the karst archipelago where these monkeys live. The small size and fragmented nature of the remaining Cat Ba Langur population means that the species is at risk of inbreeding effects (or intrinsic effects to avoid inbreeding by not breeding at all), extremely limited mate-choice due to the small number of available females, and the chance of a natural or human disaster causing total or effective extinction. However, according to&#160;Leonard Neahga (in litt., 31 October 2019) the population would have been very small even at its peak, and would have been small for the last 12,000 years when the langurs were confined to Cat Ba as a result of rising sea levels.

The first is a langur sanctuary located inside Cat Ba National Park and a ""buffer zone"" of the World Heritage Site ""Halong Bay"". Fifty-eight percent of the remaining population lives in the sanctuary. The second is a Langur-guarding program that is meant to protect 42% of the population that exists elsewhere in the national park. This program puts the subpopulations and their ranges under joint control of the national park and local people who patrol the ranges and offer community conservation education. The most important steps in the recovery of this subspecies now are continued protection from encroachment, a reduction in the habitat fragmentation and subpopulation isolation, and an increase in reproductive output and genetic health of the entire population, suggesting the need for translocation and meta-population management, including the ex-situ population. Poaching of the Langurs specifically appears to have completely stopped on Cat Ba with the last confirmed incident in 2001, although the threat remains and the drop in population in early 2016 raises the possibility that poaching by non-local people is experiencing a revival.<br/><br/>A few <em>T. poliocephalus</em> are held in the collection of the Endangered Primate Rescue Center, Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam (Nadler 1999), numbering five individuals at time of writing, coming from only two founders.<br/><br/>Some of the recommended interventions are connecting populations across sites and designing management plans for the small captive population (Lees <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

As well as direct loss of habitat through inundation this will result in massive increases in hunting as the construction labourers will be expected to live off the land, and the reservoir formed will greatly increase accessibility to a huge area of foothill forest; without specific, directed, management, hunters will no doubt take advantage of this. A very large area of suitable habitat falls within the proposed Hukaung Tiger Reserve, but it is unclear whether this area supports morphologically typical animals. If they do not occur in Hukaung, habitat loss is a sever threat to the species, because most other protected areas in the Myanmar part of its range are highland, and habitat below 900 m is heavily degraded and fragmented, and such processes are ongoing.","Numbers are not known for this species, but the populaiton is believed to be declining rapidly owing to loss of habitat and hunting. The total population must be small, given the species’ restricted geographical  range.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in southwestern China (Dulongjiang Valley, northwestern Yunnan) and northeastern Myanmar. In Myanmar, south of the Hukaung valley, it is found only east of the Chindwin River, with allied <em>Trachypithecus pileatus</em> to the west (Pocock, 1939). The situation in the Chindwin headwaters (Hukawng valley) is unclear, because animals show morphological variation suggesting the possibility of inter-gradation with <em>T. pileatus</em> and/or undescribed variation within <em>T. shortridgei</em> (Duckworth and Tizard pers. comm). Morphologically typical animals also occur east of the Hukaung (Pidaung) and north almost to Hkakaborazi (Pocock, 1939).

The small areas of habitat where it occurs (42.4 km² in Rungwe-Kitulo and ~25 km² in Ndundulu), and the species' patchy distribution in Rungwe-Kitulo give grounds for considerable conservation concern. Totalling 68 km², its area of occupancy (AOO) is below the 500 km² upper threshold for an Endangered listing under criterion B2. At 3,518 km², the taxon’s extent of occurrence (EOO) also meets the threshold for criterion B1. In addition, the habitat is fragmented and remote sensing analyses of forest loss in Rungwe-Kitulo indicate a decline over the last 30 years, which although now slowing, is continuing. The management of Mt Rungwe is currently dependent on funds from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). Forest loss has been reduced but continues in key areas. Persistent hunting of these monkeys across Rungwe-Kitulo (and possibly Ndundulu) – especially individuals which raid crops – as well as the precarious nature of the small population in Ndundulu, where logging, charcoal making and unmanaged resource extraction are commonplace, lead us to project a continuing decline in AOO, area, extent and quality of habitat, and the number of mature individuals remaining. As a consequence, the species is here listed as EN B1ab+2ab.</p>","Habitat ranges from degraded montane and upper montane forest from 1,700–2,150 m in Rungwe-Kitulo (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012) to submontane forest in Ndundulu (Davenport and Jones 2005, Jones <em>et al. </em>2005). In Rungwe-Kitulo, the canopy is often broken and between 10 and 30 m with emergents reaching 35 m. Kipunji prefers steep-sided gullies and valley edges and is rarely found far from streams (Davenport 2013). Ridges and open areas are generally avoided and the animals are not territorial (De Luca <em>et al.</em> 2010). The forest was much reduced by logging from 1960s to 1980s (Lovett 1986, McKone and Walzem 1994, Machaga <em>et al.</em> 2004, Davenport 2005, 2006). Thick undergrowth is typical, with the tree fern <em>Cyathea manniana,</em> wild banana <em>Ensete ventricosum</em>, and large stands of bamboo <em>Sinarundinaria alpina</em> common in the south and southeast of Mt Rungwe and the northwest of Livingstone. The upper limits of this distribution are likely due to the floristic changes at around 2,000–2,200m asl, where bamboo <em>Sinarundinaria alpina</em>, often interspersed with <em>Hagenia abyssinica</em> or <em>Podocarpus latifolius,</em> dominate (Bracebridge <em>et al. </em>2011). The species rarely frequents the bamboo and leaves the forest only to raid nearby crops, especially maize. In southern Mt Rungwe, annual rainfall ranges from <em>ca</em> 185–280 cm and there is an indistinct and short dry season from June to October. In Ndundulu, the <em>Parinari excelsa</em>-dominant forest is undisturbed and the canopy is unbroken, reaching heights of 40–50 m. When comparing predictions from an interpolation analysis for a habitat suitability model with the EOO, the vast majority of the most suitable areas in Rungwe-Kitulo&#160;were already occupied by Kipunji (Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011). The best forest for Kipunji would be at mid to lower altitude with a closed canopy. However, as much of Rungwe-Kitulo contains heterogeneous forest, reflecting a history of disturbance (Davenport <em>et al.</em> 2006, Davenport, 2009), forest is often fragmented and contains a mix of primary, secondary and regenerating forest. This suggests that while not optimal, Kipunji can tolerate disturbed habitat reasonably well (Bracebridge <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The Rungwe-Kitulo forests are degraded. Logging, charcoal making, illegal hunting and unmanaged resource extraction have long been commonplace (Machaga <em>et al.</em> 2004, Davenport 2005, 2006). The narrow Bujingijila corridor linking Mt Rungwe Nature Reserve to Livingstone Forest in Kitulo National Park, and the corridors joining the northern and southern sections of Livingstone, are encroached by farmers and degraded (Davenport 2005, Mwakilema and Davenport 2005). Subpopulations are therefore fragmented even within the same forest protected area. Kipunji is hunted with log traps and with also with dogs (Davenport 2005, 2006), mainly as retribution for the crop-raiding of maize (and the leaves of beans and potatoes) and primarily from January to April. However, the monkey is also occasionally hunted for food. Although Ndundulu Forest is in good condition and largely undisturbed, the species is present there in low numbers (Davenport<em> et al.</em> 2008) and the reasons for this are unclear (Marshall <em>et al. </em>2015). Both Kilombero and Mt Rungwe Nature Reserves lack management resources.","Surveys totalling 2,864 hours and covering 3,456 km of transect were undertaken by Davenport <em>et al</em>. (2008) to determine distribution and group numbers. In addition, 772 hours of simultaneous multi-group observational follows in Rungwe-Kitulo and Ndundulu forests enabled 209 total counts to be carried out. Davenport <em>et al.</em> (2008) estimated some 1,042 individuals in Rungwe-Kitulo, ranging from 25 to 39 individuals per group (µ = 30.65; SE = 0.62; n = 34), and 75 individuals in Ndundulu, ranging from 15 to 25 individuals per group (µ = 18.75; SE = 2.39; n = 4). The total Kipunji population was thus estimated to be 1,117 animals in 38 groups (µ = 29.39; SE = 0.85; n = 38). The Ndundulu population is restricted and the Rungwe-Kitulo population is highly fragmented with isolated subpopulations remaining in degraded habitat (Davenport<em> et al.</em> 2008). Kipunji densities appear to be over three times greater in the secondary forests of Rungwe-Kitulo than in the primary forests of the Udzungwa population (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2008), which is likely an effect of forest quality, but also perhaps competition with other diurnal primates not present in Rungwe-Livingstone (Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Decreasing,"A Tanzanian endemic known from two populations separated by <em>ca</em> 350 km of non-forested, agricultural land. One population is at 1,750–2,450 m asl in 12.4 km² of Rungwe-Kitulo Forest (Davenport <em>et al. </em>2008) in the Southern Highlands of south-western Tanzania (09.12º-09.18ºS, 33.67º-33.92ºE). The Rungwe-Kitulo Forest includes Mt Rungwe Nature Reserve (150 km²) and the Livingstone Forest (191 km²), which lies within the 412 km² Kitulo National Park (Davenport 2002, Davenport and Bytebier 2004, Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006, 2008). Mt Rungwe and Livingstone Forest (in Kitulo) are connected by the Bujingijila Corridor, a 2-km wide degraded forest connection (Davenport 2005, 2006, Mwakilema and Davenport 2005). The Kipunji inhabits the wetter forest of south Mt Rungwe and isolated groups are scattered in the north and south of Livingstone Forest (Davenport <em>et al. </em>2006, 2008, Bracebridge <em>et al. </em>2011).  The other population of <em>R. kipunji </em>is found at 1,300–1,750 m asl in the Vikongwa Valley, Ndundulu Forest (07.67º-07.85ºS, 35.17º-36.83ºE; <em>ca</em> 180 km of closed forest), in the Kilombero Nature Reserve in the Udzungwa Mountains, south-central Tanzania (Jones<em> et al</em>. 2015). The area known to be occupied by the species in the Ndundulu Forest is approximately 25 km² (Davenport pers obs. in Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2015) and Kipunji density is low. Research indicates that the animal is absent from the contiguous Udzungwa Mountains National Park (Davenport <em>et al.</em> 2008, Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species' area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 42.4 km² in Rungwe-Kitulo (Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011) and ~25 km² in Ndundulu (Davenport pers. obs. in Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2015), with a combined total AOO of only 67.5 km².","<p>Occasionally hunted for food.

However, only the national park has independent management activities and resources, and they remain limited, especially in the forest. The focus of current Kipunji conservation work is the protection and restoration of the montane habitats of Mt Rungwe, especially the forest connections, such as the (2.1 km²) Bujingijila corridor (Davenport 2006, Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011). Protecting corridors is of the highest priority for the conservation of this genus/species and Bujingijila could provide habitat for an additional 88 Kipunji (8% population increase), using density estimates from the 2008 census (Bracebridge <em>et al</em>. 2013). It also has the benefit of reconnecting the Mt Rungwe and Kitulo kipunji subpopulations.&#160;Furthermore, conservation management, while focusing on promoting old growth forest, should also consider populations of some important pioneer tree species such as <em>Macaranga capensis</em>, both in the forest and in reforestation schemes outside the species’ current Area of Occupancy (Bracebridge <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p><p>Kipunji is being used as a 'flagship species' by WCS's long-term Southern Highlands Conservation Program in and around Rungwe-Kitulo, especially in education and awareness raising activities, and as part of a long-term monitoring programme.

In mature forest it forages on the ground in areas with a clear floor and numerous lianas and tree trunks (Ambrose 2013). Diet is predominantly fruit, along with insects, snails and frogs (Charles-Dominique 1977). At Makokou the ranges of males (30-60 ha) were 3-5 times greater than those of females (8–10 ha) (Charles-Dominique 1977). Adult females are inferred to give birth once each year, usually to a singleton, but occasionally to twins (Charles-Dominique 1977).","Habitat loss is the main threat to populations of this species, because it is not targeted by human hunters (although it may occasionally be caught in snares set for other mammals). Both small-scale forest clearance for subsistence farming and industrial logging contribute to forest loss within the range of <em>S. gabonensis</em>, with industrial logging being the most significant factor in Gabon (Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. 2018). The spread of industrial agriculture in the African moist-forest zone, particularly oil-palm cultivation, is a growing threat (Arcus Foundation 2014). FAO (2015) reports that annual forest loss in 2010-2015 was 1.1% in Cameroon, 0.9% in Gabon, and 0.1% in Republic of Congo. Selective logging of mature forest and rotational small-scale farming are not major threats to this species because of its ability to utilize secondary forest, but it will not persist where there is large-scale conversion of forest to cropland (such as monoculture oil-palm plantation).","This species has not been carefully studied across most of its range. Ambrose (2003) found it to occur in relatively low densities in primary forest in Cameroon, with the highest densities in logged littoral forest.

This nocturnal, arboreal species primarily feeds on gums and resins from trees and lianas, supplemented by invertebrates. Foraging individuals follow a regular route in the forest canopy, visiting gum-producing sites in sequence, and making an average of 100 gum-collections each hour (Charles-Dominique 1977, Ambrose 1999). Individuals forage alone but sleep communally. Females give birth to a single offspring annually (Charles-Dominique 1977).","There appear to be no major threats to <em>E. elegantulus</em>.

This habitat loss will almost certainly accelerate into the future until most individuals remain only in protected areas.","<em>Euoticus pallidus </em>is usually found in the mid to high canopy of tropical moist forest, including secondary forest. It feeds on tree gums and resins. It appear to be largely confined to lower elevations, perhaps due to a paucity or absence of gum-producing trees at higher elevations (above 1,600 m asl) (Oates pers. obs. 2016). It gives birth to a single young annually.","The primary threats to <em>Euoticus pallidus</em> are the loss, degradation and fragmentation of its habitat through conversion of forest for subsistence and commercial agriculture, and extraction of timber. Underlying these pressures are high and rapidly increasing human populations over a major part of the species’ range, combined with economic development. Statistics from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization show an increase in the rate of forest loss in Nigeria from 2.7% per annum 1990–2000, to 5.0% per annum 2000–2015 (FAO 2015). This trend is likely to accelerate until most forest remains in protected areas only. In addition to subsistence farming, there are a growing number of large-scale agricultural projects for crops, such as oil palm, in southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon (Linder 2013), while major road projects are planned or in progress that will devastate areas of community forest habitats that are suitable for <em>E. pallidus</em> (Torto 2016).","<em>Euoticus pallidus</em> is a relatively uncommon species, although encountered regularly at some sites.

The causes for this reduction have not ceased. Over the coming 45 years, this decline is suspected to reach similar proportions due to continuing habitat loss, fragmentation and impacts of wildlife trade on this species.","This species is found in moist, seasonal evergreen and mixed deciduous-evergreen forests. It has been recorded to about 1,500 m in Cambodia and to around 1,200 m in Thailand. This species is similar to <em>H. lar</em> in diet and general ecology, consuming mostly fruits, shoots, and some immature leaves, as well as insects (Srikosamatara 1980, 1984). Researchers find the species somewhat shyer and more elusive than <em>H. lar</em> (W.

In Thailand, all populations are now within protected conservation areas and the era of logging and slash-and-burn agriculture (Brockelman 1983) is now mostly over. Nevertheless, severe encroachment has occurred in eastern Khao Yai Park and other major protected areas, and subsistence hunting by minor forest product collectors is still uncontrolled (Phoonjampa and Brockelman 2008). In Cambodia, however, habitat destruction is a more immediate threat than poaching, especially in remote areas. Most populations are not yet secured in protected areas, and the main threats are habitat loss due to logging, agricultural conversion, hydroelectric development and new human settlements (W. Brockelman pers. comm.).","In Cambodia, the primary area of importance is the Cardamom Mountains, in the southwestern part which is relatively intact, where densities are in the order of 1-2 groups/km<sup>2</sup>, with an estimated 20,000 individuals (Traeholt <em>et al</em>. 2005). Populations in the north, where the habitat is similar but more open with a very small percentage of evergreen forest, are smaller. Bokor National Park in southwestern Cambodia has an estimated 1,000 groups and is likely to be isolated from the remainder of the range (Traeholt <em>et al</em>. 2005). Pileated gibbons might number around 35,000 individuals in Cambodia in total (Traeholt <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nielson <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, the population is significantly smaller, mainly since it comprises a smaller part of the range (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The average group size in Thailand is four individuals (Brockelman and Poonjampa unpubl. data).<br/><br/>In Thailand, there are an estimated 12,000 individuals (3,000 breeding groups) surviving in the four largest forest areas, including five major protected areas (Khao Yai National Park, Thap Lan National Park, Khao Ang Ru Nai Sanctuary and Khao Soi Dao Sanctuary), based on an auditory census in 2004–2005, plus around 1,000 to 2,000 individuals in 15 other scattered and highly fragmented smaller protected areas (Phoonjampa and Brockelman unpub. data). Population densities are generally low, averaging close to one group (average 4 individuals)/km<sup>2</sup>, with pockets of higher density populations in some remote mountain areas (Brockelman and Srikosamatara 1993).

In Cambodia the major stronghold is three contiguous protected areas, including Samkos and Aural Wildlife Sanctuaries, and the Central Cardamom Protected Forest. This last area contains about 3,350 km<sup>2</sup> of gibbon habitat and a population of nearly 7,000 groups. This potentially could ensure the long-term survival of the species if effectively managed. The Cambodian Forestry Administration, in collaboration with Conservation International, is developing a management plan for this area, and ranger units have been established to stop illegal poaching and logging. Gibbons also occur in Bokor National Park (1,220 km<sup>2</sup> of habitat), which is generally well managed. As in Thailand, numerous smaller fragmented areas also contain pileated gibbons, most with low long-term prospects. In Cambodia, there is a need to strengthen protected area administration and protection activities, and to halt logging and development activities in important conservation areas (W. Brockelman pers comm.; Traeholt <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>In southeast Thailand, all populations are included within protected areas, but more effort needs to be made to change the behavior of local villagers who hunt.

In 2009, a conservation intervention through community involvement was made at the iconic study site of Srikosamatara (1980) in North Ta-riu watershed, Khao Soi Dao wildlife sanctuary, with success. Before the intervention, the gibbon population declined by 70% between 1979 to 2008, as a result of opportunistic hunting for bush meat by local Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) collectors. A social theory called “Diffusion of innovations” and “Conservation marketing” was applied, using educational and campaign materials,&#160;and resulted in increased conservation behavior among local NTFP collectors. In 2012, the gibbon population increased by 20% (Kolasartsanee and Srikosamatara 2014). Re-survey in 2016 showing further increase of gibbon population indicated a persistence effect of 2009 intervention on conservation for at least 7 years (Kolasartsanee 2016).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The reduction is driven by a corresponding loss of suitable habitat (that has averaged 1% annually in Borneo over the past 30 years) and is expected to continue at that rate (or higher) for the next 10 to 20 years, as well as by significant losses due to hunting and live capture for the pet trade.","<p>The species inhabits a range of primary, secondary and selectively logged tropical evergreen forest types (<em></em>Cheyne 2010, Cheney <em>et al</em>. 2016, Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2010, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009)<em></em>. Peat swamp forest is a particularly important forest type for <em>H. albibarbis</em> (Cheyney 2008, 2010; Cheyney <em>et al.</em> 2008). <em></em><em></em><em></em> Population densities are correlated with forest structure (Hamard <em>et al.</em> 2010, Cheyne<em> et al.</em> 2016, Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2014), altitude (Marshall 2009), and the abundance of important fallback foods (Marshall and Leighton 2006). The species appears able to adapt to low to moderate levels of selective logging, although additional studies are needed to characterize the extent of their tolerance of forest degradation (Cheyne <em>et al.</em> 2013, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/><em>Hylobates albibarbis</em> is chiefly arboreal and diurnal. The species is socially monogamous and highly territorial (Mitani 1987); estimates of territory size are 47 ha at Sabangau (Cheyne 2010) and 30-43 ha at Gunung Palung (Mitani 1990; Marshall 2004). The taxon is predominantly frugivorous, preferring ripe, sugar-rich fruits (Cheyne 2008, Cheyne <em>et al.</em> 2016, Dillis <em>et al</em>. 2014, McConkey 2000, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2018) <em></em><em></em> although unripe fruits, immature leaves, insects, and flowers are consumed during periods of low fruit abundance (Coiner-Collier <em>et al</em>. 2016, McConkey 1999<em></em>).</p>","<p><em>Hylobates albibarbis</em> is threatened by habitat loss within peat swamp ecosytems due to the expansion of agricultural plantations, clear-felling for timber and, to a lesser extent, selective logging, all of which are exacerbated by forest fires associated with El Niño events (Oka<em> et al</em>. 2000, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2014; Bartlett 2007, Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2007, Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2015; Struebig <em>et al.</em> 2015, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2016). Illegal hunting and live capture for the pet trade pose additional threats (Nijman 2005). Between 1973 and 2017, Borneo (overall) has lost an average of 1% of its forest cover annually (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018), and the most recent Global Forest Watch data indicates this rate continues. If conditions do not change, a loss of close to 50% of suitable habitat can be anticipated over the course of three generations (45 years).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of the total number of individuals remaining, although the species is generally common in suitable habitat. A tentative estimate based on surveys from 2005-2018 suggests a population size of 22,000 individuals within the mixed-swamp forests in Sabangau, representing one of the largest remaining populations of this species (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2016; Cheyne 2010, Hamard <em>et al.</em> 2010). Population density estimates in undisturbed habitats range widely among forest types, from less than 0.5 individuals/km<sup><span lang=""ES-TRAD"">2</sup> in montane forests to more than 10 individuals/km<sup><span lang=""ES-TRAD"">2</span></sup> in lowland and swamp forests (Marshall 2004, 2009, 2010; Marshall and Leighton 2006). Lowland and peat swamp forests support high densities and population abundance declines predictably with altitude (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2016; Marshall 2004, 2009, 2010; Marshall and Leighton 2006). Long term monitoring in Gunung Palung National Park suggests that upland forests are of insufficient quality to maintain viable gibbon populations in the absence of inputs from lowland source forests (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2009). Population density appears to be highly stable in the absence of hunting or habitat degradation (Marshall <em><span lang=""ES-TRAD"">et al.</em> 2014), presumably due to the slow life histories and low infant and juvenile mortality in this taxon (Mitani 1990, Marshall 2009, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009).

The species as a whole is found in northern Sumatra (Indonesia), throughout Peninsular Malaysia (except for a narrow strip between the Perak and Mudah Rivers, where <em>H. agilis</em> occurs), north through southern and eastern Myanmar (east of the Salween River), most of Thailand (though not in the north-east; Marshall <em>et al</em>. 1972), and marginally into southern China, though now extirpated there (Grueter <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>No population estimates are currently available for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar (Ellefson 1974; Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2013). While for Lao PDR, there are no reliable estimates, but for Nam Poyi National Protected Area (which is the only protected area from which they are recorded; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995), the species is uncommon to rare, perhaps numbering in the mid- to high-hundreds (Boonratana 1997; Boonratana <em>et al</em>. 2011; Geissmann 1991). In some parts of Thailand there are several populations where numbers are at least in the thousands, though in northern Thailand they are now very rare. The largest population is in Kaeng Krachan National Park, which probably has on the order of 3,000-4,000 individuals. The Western Forest Complex may well have on the order of 10,000 animals, and likely upwards of 1,000 survive in the western part of Khao Yai National Park, as well as in Phukhieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Nam Nao National Park. <br/><br/>The major threat to this species is hunting (having replaced forest clearance as the top threat); they are hunted both for subsistence food use and for the pet trade (Bartlett, 2007; Malone <em>et al</em>. 2001; Osterberg, <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Hunting pressure varies across the range but takes place even within protected areas. Much of the hunting is done by villagers exploiting <em>Aquilaria</em> spp. trees prized for their aromatic wood, and other forest products (W. Brockelman pers. comm.). Over the coming 45 years, this decline is suspected to reach similar proportions due to continuing habitat loss, fragmentation and the impacts of wildlife trade on this species.</p>","<p>This species is found in evergreen, semi-evergreen, and mixed evergreen-deciduous forest (sometimes known as ""dry evergreen"" forest, in the northern parts of its range), and is known to utilize regenerating secondary forest and selectively logged forest (Johns 1985). In northwestern Thailand, white-handed gibbons utilize patches of dry evergreen, mixed deciduous, and bamboo forest near Karen settlements if they are not hunted. This is predominantly a lowland species (below 1,000-1,500 m).<br/> <br/> Like most other species of gibbon, <em>H. lar</em> consumes a largely frugivorous diet that includes mainly figs, as well as young shoots, leaves, some flowers, and insects. Gibbons, unlike most macaques and leaf monkeys that often share their habitats, swallow nearly all the seeds that they ingest, making them potentially important as seed dispersers. Certain species of fruits that require the consumer to remove a tough outer cover appear to rely almost entirely on gibbons for seed dispersal (Bartlett 2007; Ellefson 1974; Gittins and Raemakers 1980; MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1978; Palombit 1992, 1997; Ungar 1995). <br/><br/>Generation length in white-handed gibbons is on the order of 15 years. They mature late, with females maturing at 8-10 years and males at 8-12 years and have one offspring every 3 to 5 years (Brockelman <em>et al</em>. 1998). If a female loses a baby, she may come into oestrus sooner, but the average inter-birth interval in a population at carrying capacity is about 3.5 years (W. Brockelman pers. comm.). Average group size in <em>H. lar</em> generally increases with latitude, illustrating that group size is not a very useful species-specific character in gibbons. This reflects a general trend of increasing birth rate with latitude found in many vertebrate groups. Average group size has been reported at 2.7 (Chivers 1978) and 3.3 (Ellefson 1974) individuals in Peninsular Malaysia, 3.7 in central Thailand (Brockelman and Srikosamatara 1993), and 4.4 (Carpenter 1940) and 4.9 (Yimkao and Srikosamatar 2006) in northern Thailand. The average home range sizes are 44-54 ha on the Malayan peninsula (Ellefson 1974, Gittins and Raemaekers 1980, MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980) and about 16 ha in the Khao Yai National Park in Thailand (Chivers 1984a,b).</p>","<p>The major threat to this species is hunting (having replaced even forest clearance as the top threat); they are hunted both for subsistence food use and for the pet trade (Bartlett 2007, Malone <em>et al</em>. 2001, Osterberg <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Hunting pressure varies across the range but takes place even within protected areas. Much of the hunting is done by villagers exploiting <em>Aquilaria</em> spp. trees prized for their aromatic wood, and other forest products (W. Brockelman pers. comm.).<br/> <br/> Construction of roads through protected areas (for example, the Security Highway through Nam Poyi in Lao PDR, the north-south highway in Peninsular Malaysia) may also pose a threat since it promotes forest clearance and strip development, possibly increases fragmentation, and increases access by hunters into protected areas. Ongoing localized forest loss due to shifting agriculture and commercial plantations of palm oil poses a threat. On northern Sumatra, most of the lowland forests have been logged out and the threat of Ladia Galaskar, a network to link the west and east coasts of Aceh province, means that much of the remaining forest is at risk.</p>","<p>Population densities for this species range from 2.4 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in Ketambe, Sumatra (Palombit 1992) to 0.7-2.6 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in Kuala Lompat and Tanjong Triang on the Malayan peninsula (Bartlett 2007, Ellefson 1968, 1974; MacKinnon 1977, MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1978) to 6.5 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (Bartlett 2009, Reichard and Barelli 2008, Reichard 2009). A few smaller, fragmented populations survive in southern Peninsular Thailand and northwestern Malaysia, perhaps together numbering in the low thousands. There are no recent estimates of the populations in the Tenasserim section of Myanmar, northern Sumatra and in southern Peninsular Malaysia (W. Brockelman pers. comm.).<br/> <br/> In China, during the 1960s, there were estimated to be 200 individuals on both sides of the Nangunhe River. In 1988, the date of last sighting, it was estimated that there were less than 10 groups. And in 1992, the last survey date, the authors did not find any direct evidence for the species' persistence but estimated that three groups may remain with about 10 individuals in total.

The break in distribution between Perak and Muda/Thepa Rivers on the Malaysian Peninsula is genuine (Carpenter 1940, Geissmann 1984, Harcourt and Schwartz 2001, Matsudaira <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species also occurs in a small area of northwestern Lao PDR (west of the Mekong River). The range formerly extended into southeastern Thailand, where it was parapatric with <em>H. pileatus</em> (Brockelman 1978, Brockelman and Gittins 1984, Phoonjampa and Brockelman 2008).

However, in most countries, these areas are not well patrolled, even if they are well managed for tourism. There is an urgent need for improved protection of these areas, ideally involving local communities that should benefit from as well as participate in management. Illegal use of forest products, as well as poaching, is common in most protected areas. Inadequate management and protection, rather than forest destruction, are the main long-term threats and conservation efforts must seek to identify the hunters and incorporate them into new management priorities.<em><br/> </em><em></em>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The population reduction is due to widespread local hunting for cultural reasons and loss of habitat, particularly in North Pagai, South Pagai and Sipora Islands.","<p>This species is arboreal, diurnal, and omnivorous, though predominantly frugivorous (Whitten 1982a). Although disturbance levels in this species' habitat are variable on different islands, a recent survey detected similar population densities in un-logged forests, forests logged 10 years ago, and those logged 20 years ago (Paciulli 2004, Whittaker 2005).<br/><br/>Gibbons in the Siberut area studied by both Tenaza (1974, 1975) and Tilson (1980) had unusually small average home ranges of 7-11 ha. A gibbon group studied in a different area on Siberut had a home range size of 32 ha, similar to that in other species of the genus <em>Hylobates</em> (Whitten 1980, 1982b).<br/><br/>Primarily occurs in deciduous, monsoon, tropical evergreen forests at all elevations. This species prefers the upper canopy and is also known to dwell in swamp forests. Annual rainfall in these forests are up to 4,000 mm. Primarily frugivorous, fruits make up 73% of their feeding time while insects and arthropods are consumed about 25% of the time. Breeding happens through the year with single births. Average daily movement is around 1,514 m and groups are typically composed of 4-6 individuals.</p>","<p>This species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006). It is also threatened by conversion to oil palm plantations, in addition to forest clearing and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). A recent study shows that habitat loss in the Mentawai islands was mainly due to forest conversion for agriculture expansion by local communities. A total of 73,500 ha of forest in Siberut, North Pagai, South Pagai and Sipora Islands have been allocated for oil palm plantation by the local government and about 34,000 ha (46%) was granted to only two companies (FFI, unpublished report)<br/><br/>Recently, hunting pressure has increased because of increased access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 caliber air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos which formerly regulated hunting have been eroded by brands of Christianity which have not recognised the conservation imperative (Whittaker 2006). The pet trade is also a threat to this species (Whittaker 2006). Although this may be a greater threat to this species than to other gibbons (D. Whittaker pers. comm.), it is rarely seen in the pet-trade in Java (Nijman 2005). A recent report (Quinten <em>et </em><em>al.</em>&#160;2014) suggests Kloss’s gibbons to be rarely hunted. The Kloss’s Gibbons of Paelonan forests of Siberut Island are reported to exhibit ‘decoy’ behavior, wherein one member of the troop distracts the incumbent human danger while the rest of the troop escape. This is seen as an effective behavioral trait to escape human predation (Dooley and Judge 2014).<br/><br/>The extent of the threats from logging, hunting, and the pet trade faced by this species varies depending on location. The very large population in Siberut National Park, on central Siberut, lives in a protected area but is subject to moderate hunting pressure from local people. In the Peleonan forest, northern Siberut, the habitat was logged 20 years prior but faces low hunting pressure. This area is significant because four of the endemic Mentawai primates (<em>H. klossii, Simias concolor, Presbytis potenzian</em>i and&#160;<em>Macaca siberu</em>) exist here in high densities. Populations in Saureinu, Sipora are subject to traditional use by locals but limited logging. In South Pagai, forest plots are selectively logged but there is high hunting pressure. Animals on North Pagai were not censused, but logging and hunting occurs there as well (Whittaker 2005b).</p>","John and Kathy Mackinnon (1984, 1986) estimated the total population of <em>Hylobates klossii</em> to be 36,000 individuals. Whittaker (2005) revised this estimate to 20,000-25,000 animals nearly 20 years later. More recently, Hoing <em>et al</em>. (2013) gathered population estimates on all four Mentawai Islands (Siberut, Sipora, North Pagai and South Pagai) using loud-call monitoring and forested area estimates to census the animals. Throughout the Mentawai Islands, density averaged 12 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>. The largest population (~10,500 individuals; 3.67-6.5 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) is found in Siberut National Park and represents 72.21% of the island’s population. The smallest remaining population is that found on Sipora, comprising 753-880 individuals (Paciulli 2005, Höing <em>et al</em>. 2013). The combined populations on North and South Pagai are estimated at 2,029 individuals (Paciulli 2005,&#160;Höing&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). Based on these studies, the most recent estimate of the total population would be approximately 17,500, a decline of more than 50% of that estimated in the 1980s.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the four Mentawai Islands (Siberut, Sipora, North Pagai and South Pagai) off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia (Marshall and Sugardjito 1986, Geissmann 1995, Groves 2001).",This species is collected for the pet trade and hunted for cultural ceremonies.,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I, and is protected by Indonesian law. More than half of the remaining Kloss's gibbons reside in Siberut National Park, a government protected area. Whittaker (2005b, 2006) suggested the following conservation actions: 1) increased protection for Siberut National Park, which currently lacks enforcement, 2) formal protection of the Peleonan forest in North Siberut, which is home to unusually high primate populations and is easily accessible, 3) protection of areas in the Pagai Islands by cooperating with a logging corporation that has practiced sustainable logging technique there since 1971, 4) conservation education, especially regarding hunting, and 5) the development of alternative economic models for the local people to reduce the likelihood of selling off their lands to logging companies (Whittaker 2006).<br/><br/>The more recent Workshop of the National Strategic and Action Plan for the Conservation of the Kloss’s Gibbons which involved participants from the central and local governments, local governments, scientists and academicians, NGOs, protected area managers and private sector, outlined several key strategies and conservation issues, including:<br/><br/>1) <em><u>Spatial planning</u></em>: avoid infrastructure development within the Kloss’s gibbon habitats, identify and map priority Kloss’s gibbon habitats, protection of the remaining Kloss’s gibbon habitats outside the Siberut NP, incorporate the Kloss’s gibbon strategic and action plan into the spatial planning.<br/><br/>2) <em><u>Concessions</u></em>: identify and map Kloss’s gibbon distribution within concessions, implement robust monitoring protocol for Kloss’s gibbon population within the concessions, designate and protect Kloss’s gibbon habitats and corridors within the concessions, implement SMART patrol system within the concessions.<br/><br/>3) <em><u>Kloss</u></em><em><u>’s gibbon population and ecology</u></em>: develop standardized robust monitoring protocol for Kloss’s gibbon population and consistently implement it across the remaining populations and habitats, define and designate centers for Kloss’s gibbon ecological researches, habitat restoration and rehabilitation, and habitat enrichments.<br/><br/>4) <em><u>Community awareness and education</u></em>: implement conservation campaign and awareness programs, appoint Kloss’s gibbon ambassador, develop and implement Kloss’s gibbon conservation award programs.<br/><br/>5) <em><u>Law enforcement</u></em>: implement SMART patrol system in the protected areas, implement road block patrols, work with seaport authorities to prevent and strengthen law enforcement against illegal trade of the Kloss’s gibbons, establish a community-supported investigation network, and establish and operate a network of guard posts at optimum check point locations.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

This is inferred from work on sympatric Sumatran orangutans (Campbell-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gaveau et <em>al</em>. 2009, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016), mainly as a result of expanding agriculture, land clearance through fire, and road building, calculated to be over 50% over the past 45 years (approximately 3 generations), in combination with poaching and illegal trade for the pet market (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2015, O'Brien and Kinnaird 2011, Sultan <em>et al</em>. 2009). In some areas of the species' Sumatran range, humans opportunistically hunt agile gibbons for consumption (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2015, Gittins 1983, Gittins and Raemakers 1980, Lee <em>et al</em>. 2015). Threats are occurring primarily in the Sumatran portion of its range where the species seems to be declining rapidly and is certainly endangered. On the mainland (Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand), there seem to be a number of stable populations, but the range is contracting. The species is entirely confined to closed canopy forest, and thus, habitat conversion, road building and fragmentation are increasingly threatening the species (Gittins 1983, Gittins and Raemakers 1980, Lee <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>","<p>This species occurs at highest densities in dipterocarp-dominated forests, but their known habitat ranges from swamp and lowland forests to hill, submontane, and montane forests (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004; Yanuar 2009). Additionally, populations in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in Sumatra do not seem to avoid forest edges near human habitations (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004), a behavior that has also been observed in the Batang Toru Forest Complex, North Sumatra, Indonesia (Nowak pers. obs.). While they prefer undisturbed primary forest, some studies from Sumatra indicate that they can also be found in previously disturbed regenerating forest (Sultan <em>et al.</em> 2009; Lee <em>et al.</em> 2015). In southern Sumatra, populations were found up to 1,400 meters (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>These arboreal and diurnal primates are primarily frugivorous (preferring fruits high in sugar, such as figs), but they will consume flowers, immature leaves, and insects as well (Gittins 1979, 1982). An average home range size of 29 ha has been determined in a study at Sungai Dal (Gunung Bubu Forest Reserve) on the Malayan peninsula (Gittins 1979, 1982; Gittins and Raemaekers 1980), whereas a study from within and in areas surrounding Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia has documented average home ranges of 22.5 ha in forest fragments and 24.7 ha in more continuous forested areas (Yanuar and Chivers 2010). Within the submontane forests of the Batang Toru Forest Complex, agile gibbons have been documented to have home ranges over 50 ha (Nowak pers. obs.).&#160; <br/><br/>Wild gibbons from the genus <em>Hylobates</em> are known to have relatively slow life histories, including a late age at first reproduction (8-12 years) and long interbirth interval (2.2-3.8 years) (Palombit, 1995; Reichard and Barelli, 2008; O’Brien and Kinnaird 2011). Recent work by O’Brien and Kinnaird (2011) has also shown that agile gibbons in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park have extremely low birth (0.22-0.28 infants female<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and infant to juvenile survival rates (33.3%), which they suggest is related to increased resource competition with larger and more abundant sympatric species (e.g. siamangs).</p>","<p>On Sumatra, this species is threatened by forest conversion, mining, road construction, human encroachment, and a subsequent opportunistic capture for the pet trade and in some areas human consumption. These threats extend to populations within national parks and forests, including illegal agricultural and road development inside designated conservation areas. Between 1985 and 2007 on Sumatra, nearly 50% of the conceivable habitat for this species was lost to logging, road development, and conversion to agriculture or plantations (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2015<em></em>). Forests, where they remain, are extremely fragmented (Estrada <em>et al. </em>2017). Agricultural expansion (e.g., coffee, oil palm, and rubber), in addition to the expansion of pulp-paper and sawn-timber plantations, are currently the main drivers of forest loss on Sumatra (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003<em></em>). A recent report indicates that agile gibbons are often encountered in Indonesian wildlife markets and are a common species entering the Kalaweit rehabilitation center in Padang, Sumatra, Indonesia (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The species' status in Malaysia is more uncertain, however, as with Sumatra, oil palm expansion has been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in Peninsular Malaysia (Miyamoto <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Thailand there is extensive conversion of forests to rubber plantations and other crops (even inside protected areas), as well as hunting for the pet trade.</p>","<p>O'Brien<em> </em>and Kinnaird (2011) performed a population assessment in 2002 on agile gibbons in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia, which is one of the larger and most contiguous protected forest blocks remaining within their current distribution. Using calling counts in both forest edge and interior habitats, and basing their estimate on forest cover area in the park, they calculated a population of 4,479 agile gibbons (CV = 30%) (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004). Other key forested areas for Sumatran agile gibbons include Berbak, Bukit Tiga Puluh, Kerinci Seblat, Sembilng, and Way Kambas National Parks, in addition to Bukit Rimbang Bukit Baling Wildlife Reserve. In Peninsular Malaysia, the Belum, Selama, and Ulu Muda Wildlife Reserves are strongholds. Portions of the population in Thailand likely number a few thousand individuals, located in approximately four forest fragments, including the Bang Lang, Budi-Sungai Padi, and Namtok Sipo National Parks, and Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary (W. Brockelman pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Density estimates for this species range from 1.4-2.8 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Bukit Barisan Seletan (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004), 8.8-15.5 individual/km<sup>2</sup> in Batang Gadis National Park (Sultan <em>et al.</em> 2009), 6.3-13.4 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Harapan Rainforest (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2015), 6.0-11.4 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Kerinci-Seblat (Yanuar 2009), and 1.9 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Way Kambas to 5.5-18.9 individuals (2-5 groups)/km<sup>2</sup> in Sungai Dal on the Malay peninsula (Gittins 1979). Surveys in southern Thailand reveal the density to be 1.1-3.3 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in parts of Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary (Nongkaew 2010). The density estimates from both Batang Gadis National Park and Harapan Rainforest are particularly interesting as they indicate that Sumatran agile gibbons can occur at relatively high densities in previously degraded regenerating forests.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in Sumatra, Indonesia (southeast of Lake Toba and the Singkil River), Peninsular Malaysia (from the Mudah and Thepha Rivers in the north to the Perak and Kelanton Rivers in the south) and south Thailand (near the Malaysian border, east of the Thepha River watershed) (Gittins 1979; Groves 2001; Marshall and Sugardjito 1986; Sultan <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>","The species is opportunistically captured for the pet trade and, in some areas, for human consumption.",Terrestrial,"<p>Agile gibbons are protected throughout their range by local laws, whereas all international commercial trade is prohibited through its listing on CITES Appendix I.

Unfortunately, many of these are merely gazetted or proposed, and as such, their actual protected status is uncertain. Moreover, many of the Sumatran reserves are in montane regions where the species occurs only at low densities. In Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in southwestern Sumatra, as with other national parks in Sumatra that house agile gibbons, populations are presently secure and healthy, but their continued survival depends on the Indonesian government’s ability to stop the ongoing and illegal deforestation of its protected forest areas (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Ultimately, the key to conserving this species relies on the ability of local governments to uphold their national laws and regulations. Increasing monitoring capacity, improving law enforcement, stopping illegal logging, curbing legal logging and forest conversion, implementing forest restoration projects, stopping road construction, confronting human-animal conflict, and enhancing connectivity across fragmented landscapes are all key conservation actions that are urgently required.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
17967873,39779,Symphalangus syndactylus,Endangered,A4cd,2020,2015-11-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Symphalangus syndactylus</em> is considered Endangered based on a past and projected population reduction of at least 50% over the course of three generations (45 years; 2004-2048), the decline due primarily to habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss (mainly as a result of expanding agriculture, land clearance through fire, and road building), in addition to hunting for pet trade and in some areas of their distribution human consumption. Should the rate of forest loss continue to increase, this species' status could easily become critical, so close monitoring is essential.<br/></p>","<p>This species lives in primary and secondary semi-deciduous and tropical evergreen forest. All levels of the canopy are used, although emergent trees are required for resting and sleeping. Siamangs occur at lower densities in secondary forest, but can persist in secondary areas. They range from the lowlands up to 2,000 m in elevation in some areas of Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia (Yanuar 2009), with preferences for lowland and submontane/montane forest types. Siamangs are rarely found in swamp forest habitat. During a short survey in southern Sumatra, siamangs appeared to be less sensitive to habitat degradation than sympatric agile gibbons (<em>Hylobates agilis</em>) (Geissmann<em> et al.</em> 2006). Siamangs were also noted to maintain relatively high densities at forest edges within the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia (O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2004). Nevertheless, compared to sympatric agile gibbons, this species was encountered infrequently at forest edges and within disturbed forest areas in the submontane forests of the Batang Toru Forest Complex, Sumatra, Indonesia (Nowak pers. obs.). <br/><br/>Though this species is primarily folivorous in mainland Asia (Chivers 1974; MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980; Raemaekers 1984), it is primarily frugivorous on Sumatra (West 1982; Palombit 1992, 1997; Nurcahyo 1998; Lappan 2009b). For both mainland Asia and Sumatra, their fruit/leaf diet is supplemented with moderate levels of flower and insect consumption. Palombit (1992, 1997) argues that these animals are flexible foragers, preferring fruit when available, but able to switch to leaves when necessary. Such flexibility may help reduce siamang vulnerability to habitat disturbance (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003). Siamangs are strictly arboreal, highly territorial, and primarily monogamous (Chivers 1974). However, extra-pair copulations have been reported in Ketambe, Gunung Leuser National Park, Sumatra (Palombit 1994), and groups with more than one adult male have been reported in the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park population, Sumatra (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003; Lappan 2005, 2007, 2009d). Home range has been recorded at 15-47 ha on the Malayan peninsula (Chivers 1974; Raemaekers 1977; MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980) and 20-50 ha in previously studied Sumatran populations (Palombit 1997; Nurcahyo 1998; O’Brien <em>et al.</em> 2003; Lappan 2009b; Yanuar and Chivers 2010). Within the submontane forests of the Batang Toru Forest Complex, siamangs have been documented to have home ranges &gt;50 ha (Nowak pers. obs.). Dispersal distances are less than 3 km. O'Brien<em> et al</em>. (2003) found that monogamy and strict territoriality may limit the range of possible response to fire and other severe disturbances by this species. <br/><br/>Wild siamangs are known to have relatively slow life histories, including long interbirth intervals (&gt;3-4 years) (Palombit 1995; O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003). The infant to subadult survival rate in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park for ‘normal’ groups was 61.7%, whereas for groups affected by ENSO-related wildfires, infant to subadult survival rate was substantially less (22%; O’Brien <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;</p>","<p>This species is threatened by forest conversion, mining, road construction, human encroachment and opportunistic poaching for pet trade and human consumption on Sumatra, with these threats often extending to populations in national parks and protected forests. Between 1985 and 2007 on Sumatra, over 40% of the conceivable habitat for this species was lost to fires, logging, road development and conversion to agriculture or plantations (Laumonier<em> et al</em>. 2010). The forests, where they remain, are extremely fragmented (Margono <em>et al.</em> 2012). Agricultural expansion (e.g., coffee, oil palm, and rubber), in addition to the expansion of pulp-paper and sawn-timber plantations are currently the main drivers of forest loss on Sumatra (O'Brien and Kinnaird 2003; Margono<em> et al</em>. 2012).

Furthermore, Lappan <em>et al</em>. (2017) have highlighted that between 2011 and 2016 that roughly 50% of their Way Canguk study population disappeared, possibly related to an epizootic disease outbreak. A similar case was described for a study group of wild siamangs at Ketambe (Palombit 1992).&#160; <br/><br/>Based on the recent data provided by Global Forest Watch, the rate of forest loss on Sumatra has accelerated over the last five years and, if that pace continues, it is possible to project a loss of nearly 60% of suitable forest habitat by mid-century.<br/><br/>The species' status in Malaysia is more uncertain, however, as with Sumatra, oil palm expansion has been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in Peninsular Malaysia (Miyamoto <em>et al.</em> 2014). Also, as in Sumatra, rates of forest loss have accelerated over the last several years and are likely to range between 70-100% within the range of <em>Symphalangus syndactylus</em>.<br/><br/>In Thailand, there is extensive conversion of forests to rubber plantations and other crops (even inside protected areas), as well as hunting for the pet trade. Global Forest Watch data indicate that forest loss within the restricted range of siamangs in southern Thailand could be as much as 50% by the year 2050.</p><p></p>","<p>In a study on this species in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, O'Brien <em>et al. </em>(2003, 2004) calculated an average group density of one group for every 2.23 km<sup>2</sup>, with an average group size of 3.9, and a population estimate of 22,390 individuals (CV = 36%). Healthy populations persist at the southern limit of its range in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, and these populations should survive over the long-term if the park maintains its present forest area, and if illegal habitat degradation and hunting are stopped (O'Brien<em> et al.</em> 2004). Other key forested areas for Sumatran siamangs include the Leuser Ecosystem, Bukit Tiga Puluh, Gunung Leuser, Kerinci Seblat, and Way Kambas National Parks, in addition to Bukit Rimbang Bukit Baling Wildlife Reserve.

17968083,39876,Hoolock hoolock,Endangered,A4acd,2019,2017-09-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Hoolock hoolock</em> remains Endangered, based upon a suspected population reduction of at least 50% over the period of three generations (2001-2015, 2016-2030 and 2031-2045), based on ongoing and significant levels of forest loss in Bangladesh, northeastern India and Myanmar, combined with ongoing and similarly significant levels of subsistence hunting and live capture for the pet trade throughout the species' range.","This species is a forest-dweller that, depending on its locale, inhabits tropical evergreen rainforests, tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, tropical mixed deciduous forests, and subtropical broadleaf hill forests. It has also been noted in bamboo “brakes” and hollock (<em>Terminalia myriocarpa</em>) and ajhar (<em>Largerstroemia flosreginae</em>) plantations. One gibbon pair in the Borajan Reserved Forest (north-east India) was observed to habitually descend from the trees to move over scrub and short bamboo especially while trying to reach the isolated food trees inside a village. This pair was found sleeping at heights of 0 m or less in bamboo clumps (Kakati 1997). Although gibbons may be moving through, or sleeping in, bamboo forest or plantations, they cannot survive in monocultures (W. Brockleman pers. comm.). Additionally, the species has been observed in two plains forest locations (Choudhury 1991). Its preferred habitat, however, is dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (Choudhury 2001). It has been recorded at altitudes of up to 2,500 m in Manipur, northeast India (Choudhury 2001).<br/><br/>Home ranges in most populations range from 8-63 ha (Ahsan 2001, Alfred and Sati 1990, Muzaffar <em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160; Feeroz and Islam 1992,&#160; Islam and Feeroz 1992; Islam and Feeroz 1992a, Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996, Tilson 1979), but unusually large home ranges of 200-400 ha were reported from Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India (Mukherjee 19<em>96</em>). The western hoolock is a frugivorous species, with ripe fruits composing a majority of its diet (Ahsan 2001, Alfred and Sati 1990, Bin Muzaffar <em>et al.</em> 2007,&#160; Feeroz and Islam 1992, Islam and Feeroz 1992a&#160; Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996, Tilson 1979). A dominantly folivorous diet was reported during studies carried out in Assam’s Borajan Reserved Forest and in Tripura (Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996), and gibbons living in small forest fragments were observed to experience a period of almost total lack of fruit in their diet at the end of the dry season (Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996). Low fruit availability may contribute to the relatively large home range sizes of some populations. In northeast India, the hoolock gibbon is recognized as being an important disperser of undigested seeds from large and small fruit-bearing trees (Das <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In Bangladesh, the main threats are the combined effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, human interference and hunting (Islam and Feeroz 1992, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2005). Hunting is universal all over Bangladesh as well as India, and may be in Myanmar also. In China, the Tibetan population could be under threat from hunting for food or non-targeted hunting, but this is not established.<br/><br/>In some Indian locales, these animals are rare due to large scale hunting for food and because some ethnic groups believe the gibbons have medicinal properties (Gupta 2005, J. Das pers. comm). On the other hand, observations from Arunachal Pradesh (P.C. Ray pers. comm.) suggest that hoolocks are not hunted for subsistence, and may even be cherished. Density of gibbons is still high around tribal villages of several ethnic groups; the same is true in northern Myanmar. Additionally, jhoom cultivation threatens the habitats of Indian populations, some of which are relatively isolated already (Choudhury 1991). Affecting all northeastern Indian primate populations are harvesting of bamboo for paper mills, oil mining and exploration, and coal mining, which deplete habitat and cause pollution and disturbance (Choudhury 1991). Habitat fragmentation and loss are major threats in India (Kakati 2000). Small and restricted groups may not be viable because of genetic and demographic instabilities and because they are more affected by hunting pressure and habitat loss. Many small forest fragments are reported to have only one or a few gibbon groups. These have limited chances of surviving more than a few generations without translocation (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015, Das <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, shifting cultivation is a major threat, and so is hunting. Although logging is restricted on the western side of the Chindwin, it is still considered a threat for this species (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2013). Political and ethnic conflicts have prevented the Myanmar government from promoting development and conservation activities effectively in areas of northwestern and central western Myanmar along the borders with India and Bangladesh. Thus, most conservation efforts have been concentrated within the range of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em>.","There are estimated to be about 200-280 hoolocks in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2006, Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005). In China, a population has been identified in Medog Nature Reserve in southeastern Tibet, just across the border from Arunachal Pradesh, but the identity of this taxon is not established and there has been no survey conducted to determine the population numbers (W. Bleisch pers. comm).<br/><br/>This species occurs in several of India’s northeastern states, but populations there tend to be isolated. It is common in certain areas of occurrence, but rare in others due to intense hunting by local tribes (Choudhury 1991), and is considered rare throughout its range (Choudhury 2001). The species was found in all forested patches in northeastern India about 30 years ago, but they are reduced to a few forest fragments now. The total population in northeastern India is now estimated to be over 12,000, of which about 2,000 occur in the state of Assam (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005), and most of the remainder in Arunachal Pradesh. A population of about 170 gibbons has more recently been identified as <em>H. leuconedys</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2006) and should be subtracted from the population estimate if this identity is proven. Moreover, there are surveys needed in Mehao region, where there is uncertainty as to which species the gibbons there represent (Das <em>et al.</em> 2006, Das pers. comm). Namdapha National Park in the Changlang District of Arunachal Pradesh is a relative stronghold for this species in India, offering the population there its largest contiguous stretch of protected habitat (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;Recent surveys by Ray <em>et al.</em> (2015) using auditory methods have revealed high average densities of 3.47 groups per km² in the northern part of Namdapha National Park, which would yield projections of the total population in the park of over 15,000. However, caution is advised, as further surveys in the central and southern parts of the park are needed, and are ongoing.<br/><br/>There are no population estimates available for Myanmar. It is possible that the largest and most viable populations of western hoolock are to be found in this country, where at present almost no attention is paid to it (W. Brockelman pers. comm). There are several thousand square kilometres of unsurveyed forest habitat in the central-west and north-west of this country, with a particular need to survey the western areas west of Chindwin/Ayerawady River. There are reports of gibbons in Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range, but there is no knowledge of the actual population level there (W. Brockelman pers. comm. 2006). The western part of Hukuang Tiger Reserve with a large area of forest (&gt;1,000 km²) has not been surveyed, but is likely to have this species. The northern limit is just south of Hkakaraborazi National Park.",Decreasing,"This species is found in eastern Bangladesh, northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), and northwestern Myanmar (west of the Chindwin River). It might possibly occur in China (extreme southeastern Tibet). The distribution in India is restricted to points south of the Brahmaputra and east of the Dibang (Dingba Qu) Rivers (Choudhury 2001). Animals that once were common in the plains of Arunachal Pradesh (northeasternmost India) before that habitat was cultivated for agriculture and tea are not so any more (Islam and Feeroz 1992).<br/><br/>The boundary between the two species of <em>Hoolock</em> is the Chindwin River, which flows into the Ayerawady (Irrawady) River. At the headwaters in the north there is a hybrid zone or cline between the two species (since they are almost certainly not reproductively isolated). Das <em>et al</em>. (2006) reported the discovery of a population of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em> in Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India, which has traditionally been considered to be part of the range of <em>H. hoolock</em>.",This species is hunted for food throughout most of its range.

Das <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported the discovery of a population of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em> in eastern Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India, which has traditionally been considered to be part of the distribution area of <em>H. hoolock</em>. This record has yet to be proven (T. Geissmann pers. comm).<br/><br/>The boundary between the two species of hoolock gibbon, <em>H. hoolock </em>and <em>H. leuconedys</em>, is uncertain (Das <em>et al</em>. 2006, Fan <em>et al</em>. 2011a, Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2014) in the Chindwin headwaters in the north, and possibly includes a zone of intermediates or variable population (T. Geissmann pers. comm). More fieldwork is needed to investigate populations on both sides of the river and in the headwaters of the Chindwin, where there is likely to be one or more hybrid zones or clines (W. Brockelman pers. comm).","This species is hunted for meat and for use in traditional “medicine”  (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2011a, Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on CITES Appendix I.

In Myanmar, the Mahamyaing Sanctuary was created in part as a gibbon refuge, and the species occurs as well in the Bumhpabum, Hponkan Razi and Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuaries, and in the Hukaung Valley Tiger Reserve (W. Brockelman unpub.). A project has been implemented by Wildlife Conservation Society to help educate local residents – especially school children – around Mahamyiang Sanctuary, and to urge them not to hunt wildlife. The project also provides some support to the wildlife sanctuary for increased patrols. Such projects need to be implemented in the Hukaung Tiger Reserve as well, in order to reduce hunting pressures. At present tourism is not promoted in the Hukaung Valley because it is a politically sensitive area, but there is great potential for tourism to have a positive impact on local development in the future. In the meantime, alternative sources of income are needed to compensate for the bans on direct resource exploitation (W. Brockelman pers. comm).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
17968556,39775,Nomascus concolor,Critically Endangered,A2acd+3cd,2020,2015-11-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The species is listed as Critically Endangered as there is an estimate of an over 80% decline in population during the last 45 years (three generations) (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006, Luo <em>et al</em>. 2007; Luo 2011). The population has declined to around 2,000 individuals occurring in small, isolated populations of 1-29 groups. A continuing decline over the next 45 years, at the same rate, is predicted, primarily due to hunting and habitat loss (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009, Li <em>et al</em>. 2011). While the species occurs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and China, it is China that holds the most significant population, with only small populations occurring in the other two countries. The biggest threats to <em>Nomascus concolor</em>, throughout its range, include destructive local forest use and hunting, while selective logging and agriculture encroachment are additional threats (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012; Wei <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Lao PDR, despite the presence of local taboos on hunting gibbons in some areas (Geissmann 2007; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Youanechuexian <em>et al</em>. 2014), these animals are captured and killed for subsistence as well as the pet and ""medicine"" trades.</p>","This species occurs in subtropical and montane evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous forest (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009c, Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006) and in China it is restricted to broadleaved evergreen forests (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a). In the Wuliang and Ailao Mountains, <em>Nomascus concolor concolor</em> occur at altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 2,800 m (Bleisch and Chen 1991; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Li <em>et al</em>. 2011; Luo 2011) with no group occurring at elevations lower than 1,500 m (Fan pers. comm.). Food availability influenced ranging in <em>N. concolor</em>, wherein they avoided areas above 2,500 m, despite being less disturbed by human beings. In northern Viet Nam, the species was reported to occur at elevations of 1,600-2,000 m (Tien 1983). In Nam Kan NPA in Lao PDR, all records of remaining groups were made between 571 and 815 m asl (Youanechuexian <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Feeding ecology for the species has been reported as 46.5% leaves, 25.5% fruit, 18.6% figs, 9.1% flowers, 0.3% other (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a,c). They have also been reported hunting and feeding on Giant Flying Squirrels (<em>Pateurista phillippensis</em>), bird eggs, chicks and lizards (Fan and Jiang 2009). Primary forest contains important perches as sleeping trees, for social activity such as singing, for locomotion, safety cover and as food resource while in China dwarf forests serve as corridors (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a,&#160;2009c). Average group sizes for <em>N. c. concolor</em> in Yunnan province also appear to vary strongly according to locality and/or study; most groups in the Wuliang Mountains have two breeding females (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2006; Fan and Jiang 2010). Based on five groups of <em>N. c. lu</em> observed in Nam Kan PPA in Lao PDR, an average group size of 3.6-3.8 individuals was determined (Geissmann 2007). Groups in China occupy large home ranges with observations of 151 ha, 260 ha and &gt;100 ha (Fan and Jiang 2008). Daily travel distances, as studied in a group in Dazhaizi, Wuliang Mountain, vary between 300-3,144 m, with an average of 1,391 m, correlating with fruit and leaf abundance, with low travel distances in months of stress i.e. low fruit availability (Fan and Jiang 2008).","<p>  </p><p>The biggest threats to <em>Nomascus concolor</em> throughout its range include destructive local forest use and hunting while selective logging and agriculture encroachment are additional threats (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012; Wei <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Lao PDR, despite the presence of local taboos on hunting gibbons in some area (Geissmann 2007; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Youanechuexian 2014) these animals are captured and killed for subsistence as well as the pet and ""medicine"" trades. Hunting and developmental activities such as infrastructure and Road No. 3, funded by the Asian Development Bank through Nam Kan, pose additional threats (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009a; Peng-Fei <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Viet Nam, depending on the locality, these gibbons are threatened by mostly human impact on habitat and hunting pressure, but it is ultimately always a combination of the two. Other issues such as forest fire and hydropower construction threaten the Vietnamese portion of the population (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/></p><p>  </p>","While the species occurs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and China, it is China that holds the most significant population of the taxon, with only small populations in the other two countries. Population estimates for the Chinese portion of this species range from about 270 to 300 groups with the most important subpopulations in China residing in the Wuliang and Ailao Mountains (Bleisch and Chen 1991; Peng-Fei <em>et al</em>. 2009; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ninety eight groups were reported in the Wuliang Mountains (Haimoff <em>et al</em>. 1986; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Lan 1993), but a later survey just confirmed 87 groups (Luo 2011). A small population with about four groups was found in Jinggu County recently (H. Bei pers. comm). Most groups found in the Wuliang Mountains live in stable bi-female groups with an average group size of 6.2 individuals (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2006), therefore, the total population in the Wuliang Mountains is estimated to be 500-600 individuals (if an average group size of six individuals is used). In the Ailao Mountains, approximately 180 groups persist in six counties with 124 groups in Xinping, 11 groups in Chuxiong, 2 groups in Nanhua, 26 groups in Shuangbai, 9 groups in Jingdong, and 9 groups in Zhenyuan (Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012); with around 680-720 individuals (if an average group size of four individuals per group is used). In southern Yunnan there are possibly three areas where this species occurs, in Bajiaohe, Jingping County (two groups recorded), Fenshuiling Nature Reserve (possibly 1-2 groups, but not confirmed), and Huanglianshan Nature Reserve (possibly 1-3 groups, but not confirmed (Ni and Ma 2006). The total population in southern Yunnan was estimated to less than 25 individuals (Ni and Ma 2006). On the west bank of Mekong River, there are two sites with confirmed records; three groups in Yongde Daxueshan Nature Reserve (Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012) and two groups in Xuezhulingdashan. This population, formerly recognized as <em>Nomascus concolor furvogaster</em>, is on the edge of extinction.<br/><br/>The population of <em>N. c. concolor</em> in Viet Nam consists of only 22–25 groups, with <em>ca.</em> 20 groups in the contiguous Mu Cang Chai Species Habitat Conservation Area, Yen Bai Province and Muong La forests, Son La Province and only 2–5 groups in Van Ban Nature Reserve (Haimoff <em>et al</em>. 1986; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Tien 1983). In Van Nan, the population is likely decreasing and in Muong La/Mu Cang Chai it has stabilized in recent years (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The population of <em>N. c. lu</em> in Lao PDR is, likewise, heavily suppressed and is known to occur in only two areas: Nam Kan NPA and Nam Ha NPA (MAF 2011). In Nam Kan NPA, in the most recent and comprehensive surveys, only three localities were found to still hold gibbons, with 10 gibbon groups heard and 39 individuals observed. This suggests that the largest Lao PDR population is small and vulnerable; the study documented some locations previously known to have gibbons no longer did. The core population is centred around an ecotourism project which, together with local taboos against hunting, provides protection for this small population (Youanechuexian <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Decreasing,"The species as a whole occurs discontinuously in southwestern China, northwestern Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). One thousand years ago, gibbons that may have been crested gibbons (genus <em>Nomascus</em>) were distributed over a large part of southern and central China up to the Yellow River (Geissmann 1995, Luo 2011, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><strong><em>Nomascus concolor concolor</em></strong><br/>This subspecies occurs in southern China (central and southwestern Yunnan) and northern Viet Nam (Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Son La, and Lai Chau provinces) (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000).

An isolated population, it is known for certain only in a tiny area in on the east bank of the Mekong at about 20°17'-20°25'N (Groves 2001). It is confirmed in Nam Ha NPA, Luang Namtha province, and in the Nam Kan NPA, Bokeo province (Timmins and Duckworth 2013).","<p>In Lao PDR, despite the presence of local taboos on hunting gibbons in some area (Geissmann 2007; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Youanechuexian 2014) these animals are captured and killed for subsistence as well as the pet and ""medicine"" trades.</p>",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I.

While the population has undergone some sporadic declines since that time, other unprotected areas (notably Van Ban NR) have undergone precipitous declines when protections have been removed (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). These sites are protected by local conservation teams and a co-management mechanism has been put into place to allow local communities to work with protected area authorities, in order to mitigate impacts to wildlife and forests (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Nam Kan NPA is identified as the only remaining population warranting conservation intervention. This population is partially protected by an ecotourism project, the Gibbon Experience, which funds forest patrols and provides revenue to local communities, reducing risks to the resident population (MAF 2011).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Declining populations are due to the significant and ongoing threats of hunting, live capture and forest loss. The two countries in which this species occurs, Viet Nam and Lao PDR, have already lost significant tropical forest cover this century, and will likely lose substantially more should current deforestation rates continue over the next few decades. Since 2004, according to Global Forest Watch statistics, Viet Nam lost approximately  15% of its forest cover in the last 15 years (one generation)  and could conceivably  lose an additional 45% or more in the next 30 years (two generations). The situation in Lao PDR is similar: a 15% loss of forest cover from  2004-2018 and a potential 50% overall loss of forest cover (or greater)  as we approach the year 2050.&#160;&#160;&#160;  <br/></p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p><em>Nomascus siki</em> lives in tall primary broadleaf evergreen forest and, at least historically, was found between elevations of 30 to 1,900 m in a typical wet tropical climate, with no influence of the northeast monsoon and no conspicuous dry season (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Timmins and Duckworth 2013; Ujhelyi <em>et al.</em> 2000; N.M. Ha pers. comm.). Conversion of lowland forest means they are no longer found at lower elevations in Viet Nam where their primary habitat is evergreen forest from 300-1,000 m (N.M. Ha pers. comm.). In Lao PDR, gibbons are found from the Mekong plains up to 1,900 m in Nakai Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Timmins and Duckworth 2013). The species is found in both limestone and non-limestone forests (N.M. Ha pers. comm.), and may have higher densities in the later based on observations around Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park (Dat <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Gibbons are strictly arboreal, diurnal and mainly frugivorous (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000)<em></em>, but there are very few field data on the behavioral ecology of <em>N. siki</em>. Ruppell (2013) recorded an activity budget including resting (30%), feeding (33%), travelling (35%), and singing (2%) and an average home range of 37.9 hectares, with a day range of 1.48 km per day. Average group size is unknown except for a few records suggesting they live in monogamous groups of one male, one female with offspring. They start the day with loud vocalizations.</p>","<p>Hunting, in particular, is a major threat in both Viet Nam and Lao PDR where they are used both in traditional “medicine,” for food, and in the pet trade (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting of gibbons with guns is often opportunistic rather than specifically targeted at gibbons (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Unlike in Lao PDR, the forest habitat of <em>Nomascus siki</em> in Viet Nam is heavily fragmented due to the human pressures of deforestation and agricultural encroachment which, when coupled with hunting, are resulting in populations becoming small, isolated and potentially unviable in many locations (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting continues to be a significant threat to gibbons in Lao PDR, with increased access through infrastructure development opening up areas with previously relatively secure gibbon populations (Duckworth 2008). Currently, large areas of available habitat and availability of higher value species for exploitation mean that <em>N. siki</em> is relatively secure in Lao PDR, however it is expected that declines will continue at high rates due to lack of genuine protection activities in most areas (Duckworth 2008).<br/><br/>Habitat loss has negatively impacted past gibbon generations and could become a more significant threat in future years. According to Global Forest Watch statistics, Viet Nam lost approximately 15% of its forest cover in the last 15 years (one generation) and, should current rates of deforestation continue, could conceivably lose an additional 45% or more in the next 30 years (two generations). The situation in Lao PDR is similar, a 15% loss of forest cover from 2004-2018 and a potential 50% overall loss of forest cover (or greater) as we approach the year 2050.&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>  </p><p>In Viet Nam, the species has been surveyed at some level for all major areas of occurrence since 2000, with no recorded extirpations since that time, although populations appear to be small and in continuing decline because of hunting and habitat loss (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Rawson <em>et al</em>. (2011) identified key sites for conservation including two large forest complexes, the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park-Truong Son State Forest Enterprise and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise-Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve complexes. Surveys across the species' range in Viet Nam suggest that these areas support most of the known <em>N. siki </em>population in the country. Importantly, these areas are contiguous with forest in Laos where <em>N. siki </em>populations may be more robust. Sites that have recorded <em>N. siki</em> since 2000, along with minimum confirmed numbers of groups, were summarized by Rawson <em>et al.</em> (2011) and include: Khe Ve Proposed Nature Reserve - ≥ 7 groups; Giang Man Proposed Nature Reserve - ≥ 5 groups; Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park - ≥ 50 groups; Truong Son State Forest Enterprise - ≥ 10 groups; Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise ≥ 4 groups; Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve - ≥ 23 groups. While these surveys do not represent full counts of the gibbon populations at these sites, it is clear that many populations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, population estimates are generally lacking, but the species is more common than in Viet Nam, and represents the majority of the global population (Duckworth<em> et al.</em> 1999; Duckworth 2008). In Nakai-Nam Theun NPA, population density has been estimated at 1 to 3 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in a 120 km<sup>2</sup> area in the central part of the NPA (Coudrat and Nanthavong 2014). In Hin Nam No NPA, Phiapalath (2009) documented a relative abundance of 0.03 groups/km of reconnaissance trails walked with an average group size of 3.8 individuals, while, in Phou Hin Poun NPA, Phiapalath <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated an abundance of 0.37 groups/km and an average group size of 3.6. The species is known from Nam Kading, Nakai Nam Theun, Hin Nam No and Phou Hinpoun National Protected Areas, although given the uncertainty of its distribution range to the south this may be an incomplete list.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in central Lao PDR, east of the Mekong River, and central Viet Nam (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The limits of distribution of this species have been significantly reduced after the the description of <em>Nomascus annamensis</em> to the south (Thinh<em> et al</em>. 2010), which is now recognized to include much of the formerly recognized range of <em>N. siki</em>. The species distribution limits are not finally settled, both with regards to <em>N. annamensis</em> in the south and <em>N. leucogenys</em> in the north. The northern limit of the species might be the Kading River in Laos and the Rao Nay River in Vietnam (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b). The southern limit of the species in Lao PDR is unknown, but the Banghiang River could be a possible natural barrier. In Viet Nam, the species occurs in parts of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces (Rawson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011) with the southern limit as the Thach Han River (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b). It has been suggested that there may be some range overlap between <em>N. siki</em> and <em>N. annamensis</em> in Quang Tri province (N.M. Ha pers. comm.). Importantly, these areas are contiguous with forest in Lao PDR where <em>N. siki </em>populations may be more robust.</p>","Hunting, in particular, is a major threat to this species, in both Viet Nam and Lao PDR, where it is used both in traditional “medicine,” for food, and in the pet trade (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Geissmann<em> et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Terrestrial,"<p>  </p><p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I and is legally protected in Viet Nam (Appendix 1b of Decree 32, 2006) and in Lao PDR (Category 1 protected species in accordance with the Wildlife Law (2007) and Decree 81/PM of 2008). In Viet Nam, the species is assessed as EN in the Viet Nam Red Data Book (2007) but has been proposed for uplisting to CR under criteria A1cd (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Viet Nam, it has been recorded in six sites including two protected areas; Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve and two proposed nature reserves, Khe Ve and Giang Man, with the rest of its national distribution outside of the protected area network (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Protected areas in Lao PDR where the species occurs include Nam Kading, Nakai Nam Theun, Hin Nam No and Phou Hin Poun NPAs, though given the uncertainty of the southerly extent of the species distribution range it may occur in additional areas.<br/><br/>There is currently no dedicated protection or monitoring of <em>N. siki </em>in any site in Viet Nam, where uncontrolled hunting and habitat loss remain the greatest threats to <em>N. siki</em> (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The species is in decline throughout its range in Viet Nam and there are no clear instances of conservation success to control declines, either directly or as part of other biodiversity initiatives. Key sites for conservation in Viet Nam are two large forest complexes, the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park-Truong Son State Forest Enterprise and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise-Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve complexes. The most critical conservation interventions in Viet Nam are to curtail hunting of gibbons in the key sites of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve through dedicated and accountable ranger patrols (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Outside of the protected area network, within state forest enterprises which support <em>N. siki</em>, sustainable logging practices and the inclusion of biodiversity conservation in site logging plans is required (Rawson<em> et al</em>. 2011). Additional survey efforts in Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve, Giang Man Proposed Nature Reserve and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise may reveal these populations as higher global priorities than currently recognized (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, support for protected area management and protection of <em>N. siki</em> is ongoing in a number of protected areas including; Nam Kading NPA, supported by Wildlife Conservation Society; Nakai – Nam Theun NPA supported by Project Anoulak in collaboration with the Watershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA); Phou Hin Poun NPA supported by IUCN; and Hin Nam No NPA supported by GIZ-Lao Program. These sites represent the highest priority populations for conservation (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting is the main threat to <em>N. siki</em> in Lao PDR and therefore strict enforcement of gun control laws in key areas must remain a priority action for conservation groups. Additional efforts to control forest encroachment are also required to stop declines of <em>N. siki </em>populations. Eco-tourism opportunities in Lao PDR and building capacity of Lao conservationists represent investments which may have increasing impact in coming years (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Additional, research and field surveys throughout their global range, specifically tape recordings, genetic analysis and photographic recordings will likely help better define the distribution area of the taxon relative to <em>N. annamensis</em> and <em>N. leucogenys </em>(this is an on-going project implemented and coordinated by Project Anoulak <a href=""http://conservationlaos.com/"">http://conservationlaos.com</a><em>)</em><em>.</em> Knowledge of the species' ecology is also lacking, suggesting additional ecological research is required.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Though dry deciduous dipterocarp forests are present in their range, these gibbons do not appear to utilize these forests where associated semi-evergreen or evergreen forest is absent (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Channa and Gray 2009). Individuals&#160;feed mainly on fruit and leaves (Traeholt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005), although a study in Cat Tien National Park (NP) showed that their diet is made up of 38.6% of figs, 43% of other fruits, 9.5% of mature leaves and 8.9% of flowers (Kenyon 2007). Home range sizes range between 14.2 and 60.5 ha, with an average of 41 ha, but may vary depending on habitat, for example, from less than 30 ha in evergreen forest to up to 100 ha in bamboo forest in Cat Tien NP (Kenyon 2007).<br/><br/>The species was reported to be scarce above altitudes of 1,500 m (Eames and Robson 1993). However, recent studies indicated that <em>N. gabriellae</em> occurs at a wide range of elevations, from about 100 m (Cat Tien NP) up to higher than 2,287 m (Chu Yang Sin NP). Surveys above 1,500 m altitude in Bidoup-<span lang=""DE"">Nui Ba NP recorded a density of 0.29 groups/km<sup>2</sup> (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Like other gibbons, red-cheeked gibbons are arboreal and diurnal, with singing bouts averaging 12 minutes and lower calling frequencies in the wet season (Rawson 2004, Kenyon 2007). The species displays a monogamous social structure of adult pair and offspring. Average group size is estimated at 3-5 individuals. Females emigrate near, in and around their natal territories, but males emigrate farther and wider. Female give birth to single offspring at 17-22 month intervals.</p><p><span lang=""DE""></span></p>","The major threats in Viet Nam are hunting for the pet trade, habitat loss and degradation, and small and fragmented population (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The main causes of these threats are capturing of young ones by killing the mother, capture for zoos and private collection, planned or unplanned forest conversion, developmental activities such as infrastructure development, encroachment and illegal logging. Females and infants are held as pets in hotels and private areas such as zoos. Interview surveys with traders revealed at least 24-26 gibbons of the species were traded in southern provinces sourced from Lam Dong and Dong Nai province around the time of the survey, and can be sourced on demand (WCS 2009). Of 41 cases of possession of gibbons reported to ENV between 2005 and 2009, 32 were from southern provinces (ENV 2010). In Cambodia, hunting, logging and habitat loss, often due to economic land concession designation, are major threats for the species (Channa and Gray 2009, Traeholt <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The threat of habitat loss is significant, historic and ongoing.&#160; According to current Global Forest Watch data, 1) Vietnam has lost 16% of its forest cover since the turn of the century and, should current rates of forest cover loss continue, could very well lose close to 60% of its forests by the year 2045; and 2) Cambodia&#160; has lost a full 25% of its forest cover since the turn of the century and, should current rates of forest loss continue, could lose as much as 70% of its forests by the year 2045.","<p>It is likely that this species is the most common of the crested gibbons in Cambodia (Chana and Gray 2009, Traeholt <em>et al</em>. 2005) and Viet Nam (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000, Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Viet Nam, no population data were available for <em>N. gabriellae</em> in the 2000 gibbon status review (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). However,&#160; it was fairly common in some areas of Dak Lak province, and the Lam Dong Plateau seems to support a relatively large population of this species (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). After 2000, gibbon surveys have been undertaken in many sites within the species<span lang=""DE"">’ range and important populations were found both inside and outside protected areas. <br/><br/>Within protected areas, the population has been estimated as being at least 150 groups and around 500 individuals in Cat Tien NP (Kenyon 2007; Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011), 17 groups in Bi Doup-Nui Ba Mountain, part of Bidoup <span lang=""DE"">– Nui Ba NP (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010), 124 groups in Bu Gia Map National Park (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2014), 78 groups in Phuoc Binh NP (Duc <em>et al.</em> 2015), 54 groups in Hon Ba NR (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2015), and 166 groups in Chu Yang Sin NP (Thinh <em>et al.</em> in press). Smaller populations were also found in Nam Nung and Ta Dung NR (Ha <em>et al</em>. 2014, Duc <em>et al</em>. 2010), and Dong Nai NR. Outside protected areas, the populations were estimated at 86 groups in Quang Truc Commune, Dak Nong province (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2014), 56 groups in Ninh Son State Forest Enterprise, Ninh Thuan Province and about 66 groups in forest areas of Thanh Son and Son Trung Commune, and 52 groups in Son Thai - Giang Ly Communes, Khanh Hoa Province (Duc <em>et al</em>. 2015). The species was also confirmed in several state forest enterprises but no detail surveys on population have been conducted (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/></span><br/>In Cambodia, the <em>N. gabriellae </em>populations have been relatively well documented and suggest that Cambodia holds the most globally significant populations of this species (Channa and Gray 2009). In Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area, the group density is estimated from 0.71 group km<sup>2</sup> (Kidney<em> et al. </em>2016) to 0.74 groups km<sup>2</sup> <em></em> and population estimates of 646-972 and 432-832 groups in different parts of the core area by these authors respectively. Other significant populations include about 15-273 groups in Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (Channa and Gray 2009). While previous surveys suggested that Snoul and Nam Lyr Wildlife Sanctuary held significant populations (Traeholt <em>et al</em> 2005), relatively recent and ongoing rapid habitat loss within these areas suggests these populations may no longer be significant (Channa and Gray 2009). Short surveys in Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary and Prey Khieu returned no gibbon records (Channa and Gray 2009).</p><p><span lang=""DE""></p>",Decreasing,"Traditionally, the range of <em>N. gabriellae</em> includes northeastern Cambodia, southeastern Lao PDR, and southern Viet Nam, south of Bach Ma (Channa and Gray 2009, Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000, Groves 2001, Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Traeholt<em> et al</em>. 2005). Recent genetic and vocal analyses determined the existence of the additional taxon, <em>N. annamensis</em> (Thinh <em>et al. </em>2010), between <em>N. gabriellae</em> in the north and <em>N. siki</em> in the south, which has reduced the understood distribution of <em>N. gabriellae</em>; it is now understood to have a range limited to southern Viet Nam and South East Cambodia (Thinh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).

The last population in China apparently disappeared several years prior to this species' last assessment. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam, hunting and live capture continue and will likely do so over the long-term. Over a 45 year period that includes the previous generation (2005-2019) and the next two generations (2020-2049), it is suspected that suitable habitat within the species' overall range will be reduced by 60% or more which, combined with population declines due to uncontrolled exploitation, will result in an overall population decline of 80% or more.</p>","<p>This diurnal, arboreal and territorial species is found in tall primary and degraded evergreen and semi-evergreen forest. In northwestern Viet Nam and northern Lao PDR, the animals live in a subtropical climate with a short and not very cold winter without frost (Tien 1983). In Viet Nam, the species is found from 200 m to well over 1,000 m asl, with the highest record coming from Pu Mat NP from a listening post positioned at 1,500m asl (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011), however, individuals are now found mostly above 700 m due to lowland deforestation (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Lao PDR, gibbons are found from the Mekong plains up to at least 1,650 m in Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Duckworth 2008).<br/><br/>Gibbons are strictly arboreal and mainly frugivorous (Ruppell 2013), but there is very little field data on the behavioral ecology of <em>N. leucogenys</em>. Dao Van Tien (1983) studied the stomach contents of six wild-shot crested gibbons (genus <em>Nomascus</em>) from Viet Nam, including three <em>N. leucogenys</em>, and found 90-100% fruits, associated with some leaves and insects. This data cannot be directly compared to field observations, which usually measure the time spent eating various food items (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Food composition of individuals from Xishuangbanna (southern Yunnan) included fruits (39%), leaves (36%), and flowers (5%) (Hu <em>et al. </em>1989). A 12-month behavioral ecology study of the species in Nam Kading NPA shows that the species here consumed more leaves (53-85% of monthly diet) than fruits, but the percentage of fruit in the diet increased from January to May when fruits were more abundant (Ruppell 2013). On average, the three groups studied annually spent 30% of their time resting, 33% feeding, 35% travelling and 2% singing (with a seasonal variation; Ruppell 2013). During the rainy season (May-October), when many fruits are available, gibbons travel less, whereas in the dry season (November-April), gibbons eat more leaves and travel for longer distances (Hu <em>et al</em>. 1989). <br/><br/>Average group size in Yunnan province, China, was 3.78 (range 3-5, n = 9) (Hu <em>et al</em>. 1989). In anecdotal reports, group sizes of three gibbon groups from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces (southern part of north Viet Nam) were specified as 3, 3, and 4 individuals, respectively (Ha <em>et al</em>. 2005). Mean home range size of the three groups in Nam Kading NPA was 38 ha (29 - 44 ha), and the mean daily path length was 1.5 km (Ruppell 2013).</p>","<p><em>Nomascus leucogenys</em> has suffered from deforestation through agricultural encroachment into lowland and mountainous areas, in addition to fuel-wood and timber extraction from remaining forest habitats. Hunting for food and traditional medicines, as well as the live capture of young animals for the illegal pet trade, are major threats across the species' range and are regarded as a significant cause for its decline in all three countries, including its extirpation&#160; in China (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al</em>. 2018; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Viet Nam, where survey efforts have been considerable, many populations have been found to be small and local extirpations are reported as common (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Small remaining populations are vulnerable to ongoing hunting pressure and habitat degradation as well as impacts of small population sizes (e.g., disease, environmental events, inbreeding depression). Even low off-take from hunting in small populations of <em>N. leucogenys</em> can result in population collapse (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009).</p><p>Viet Nam has lost close to 15% of its forest cover since this species was last assessed in 2008 and could lose 60% or more of its forest cover the course of the next 30 years (two generations) if current annual rates do not decline. Lao PDR, the stronghold for this species, has lost more than 10% of its forest cover since this species was last assessed in 2008 and could also lose as mush as 60% or more of its forest over the course of the next 30 years (two generations).<br/></p>","<p>In China the species may now be extinct (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014). A series of surveys has documented its decline from possibly 1,000 individuals in the 1960s to probable extirpation (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Fooden 1996; Fan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014;&#160;Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). The most recent surveys in Mengla and Shangyong Nature Reserve, Yunnan, China, in 2008 and 2011 determined that the species is either extinct or functionally extinct in China (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Lao PDR holds the largest remaining populations of <em>N. leucogenys</em> due to relatively large areas of habitat, although gibbon hunting for the pet trade, bones for medicinal purposes and local consumption continues to seriously impact these populations (Duckworth 2008). Forest fragmentation is much higher in the range of <em>N. leucogenys</em> than in the ranges of other gibbon species, and the population densities are lower due to higher exploitation (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Evans <em>et al.</em> 2000). In some parts of Lao PDR, the species has been protected through hunting taboos, but these local traditions have been disappearing, leading to an increase in their hunting (Duckworth 2008). Population estimates for the Lao PDR protected area network are largely lacking, and it is unlikely that there are any 'safe' populations given hunting pressure. Population estimates in Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA include 41 and 11 groups detected across a total of 368 km<sup>2</sup> with a density of 0.13 and 0.20 groups/km<sup>2 </sup>in the two areas (Coudrat and Nanthavong 2014; Ruppell 2013). At least 10 groups were detected during a short survey in the southern part of Phou Den Din NPA. Key protected areas for the species in Lao PDR include; Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA, Nam Kading NPA north of the Nam Kading River, with second tier priorities being Phou Den Din NPA, Nam Xan NPA and Phou Khao Khouay NPA.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the species has been severely impacted by hunting and habitat loss, and now appears to persist only in pockets, largely within the protected area network. These populations, isolated by habitat fragmentation, are further internally fragmented by hunting pressure, leaving large gaps between small numbers of groups. Rawson <em>et al.</em> (2011) estimated that there may be only 300 groups remaining in Viet Nam, most of which occur close to the Lao border. It appears that the species has been recently extirpated from Hang Kia-Pa Co, Ngoc Son-Ngo Luong and Pu Luong Nature Reserves, and Khe Net Proposed Nature Reserve (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Protected areas where the species has been confirmed since 2000 include: Muong Nhe NR, Sop Cop NR, Pu Hu NR, Xuan Lien NR, Pu Hoat NR, Pu Huong NR, Pu Mat NP, Vu Quang NP, Ke Go NR (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011), although populations in many of these are very low and potentially not viable in the long-term. The two priority populations for conservation in Viet Nam are Pu Mat NP with an estimated 455 gibbons in 130 groups (22 confirmed) (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Xuan Lien NR and adjacent Pu Hoat NR, with an estimate of at least 41 groups (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in northwestern Viet Nam, northern Lao PDR and southwestern China. In Viet Nam, it occurs west and south of the Black River; it has been extirpated from several areas from which it was previously recorded and is now only known from a few localities in the north-west and north-central parts of the country (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The southern boundary of the species in Viet Nam is not well defined, however, based on genetic and vocal evidence it appears to be to at least to the Rao Nay River, near Vu Quang National Park (Thinh <em>et al.</em> 2010a, 2010b)<em>.<br/></em><br/>In Lao PDR, it occurs in the northern parts, east of the Mekong River, except for a small area in northwestern Lao PDR on the east bank of the Mekong at about 20°17'-20°25'N, where it is replaced by <em>Nomascus</em><em>&#160;concolor </em>(Geissmann<em> et al.</em> 2000). Its southern-most range limit in Lao PDR is not well defined, but it is believed to lie somewhere within Bolikhamxay-Khammouan Provinces. The Kading River is suggested as the biogeographical barrier between <em>N. leucogenys</em> and the more southerly <em>N. siki</em>, though the river towards the east is unlikely to represent a barrier given its reduced size (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b).<br/><br/>In China, the species was historically widely distributed between the Mekong and Red Rivers in Mengla, Jiangcheng and Luchun counties, in south Yunnan (Ma and Wang 1986, Fan <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, a series of surveys has documented its decline from possibly 1,000 individuals in the 1960s to probable extirpation in China (Ma and Wang 1986, Fooden 1996, Nettlebeck&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Fan and Huo 2009). The most recent surveys suggested that the species is either extinct or functionally extinct in China (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>","Hunting for food, traditional ""medicines"" and pets is a major threat across the species range, and is likely to have been the primary cause for the decline of the species in all three countries, including the presumed extinction of this species in China (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al.</em> 2018; Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I.

However, despite these legal protections there has been little effective enforcement in any country to protect this species against forest encroachment and poaching.<br/><span lang=""FR""><br/>The population in China is likely functionally extinct and, as such, direct conservation action is not necessary. However, maintenance of habitat quality within protected areas in its former range should be pursued to allow for the possibility of population reintroductions in the future.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the species is now largely restricted to the protected area network, including Muong Nhe NR, Sop Cop NR, Pu Hu NR, Xuan Lien NR, Pu Hoat NR, Pu Huong NR, Pu Mat NP, Vu Quang NP and Ke Go NR. Priority sites for conservation interventions are Pu Mat NP and Xuan Lien NR and surrounds (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Currently, no significant conservation interventions above and beyond those provided by protected areas operations are underway. Given the potential importance of these sites not just nationally, but globally, additional financial and technical investment is required, primarily to ensure effective protection as a first measure.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, the species is present in Nam Et-Phou Loey, Nam Xam, Phou Khao Khoay, Phou Panang, Nam Kading, and Phou Den Din National Protected Areas, and also in Santong Training and Model Forest and in the Nam Ngiep Subcatchment. There is an action plan for gibbon conservation in Lao PDR which includes <em>N. leucogenys</em> (MAF 2011). The action plan identifies Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA and Nam Kading NPA as first tier priorities with Phou Den Din, Nam Xan NPA and Phou Khao Khouay NPA as second tier priorities. Currently, WCS is implementing projects in both Nam Et-Phou Loei and Nam Kading NPAs with strong enforcement components.<br/><br/>Across the species' range, hunting control is a vital conservation measure: populations are already small and fragmented and, therefore, extremely vulnerable to additional off-take. Additional measures include ensuring habitat protection and improved zoning and planning to take into account key areas for gibbons within existing protected areas. Environmental education for local communities and government authorities is required. Significant technical and financial investment will be required to ensure priority areas are controlled and maintained. While this is currently occurring in Lao PDR, in Viet Nam considerable additional (international) inputs are likely to be required.<br/></span><br/>The species is commonly represented in zoo collections, both regionally and internationally, and as such there is future opportunity for reintroduction and/or population reinforcement, assuming required protocols can be met (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Quantitative analysis has also suggested that the population may face a  high risk of extinction under some ecologically feasible future  scenarios (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the late 1950s, the population was estimated to be over 2,000 individuals (Haimoff 1984, Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987). By 1989, the Hainan Gibbon population was thought to have been reduced to a single relict population of 21 gibbons occurring in four groups, restricted to a 16 km<sup>2</sup> patch of primary montane rainforest on Mt. Futouling within Bawangling National Nature Reserve (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989). The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fellowes <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bryant&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016).</p>","<p>This species currently occurs in montane rainforest, at altitudes ranging from 650 to 1,200 m (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005), although specimens were collected at lower elevations prior to the complete clearance of lowland forest on Hainan. It is diurnal, arboreal, and mostly frugivorous; the most difficult time for the gibbons to find food in Bawangling National Nature Reserve is between February and April, when only a handful of food-plant species are available for the gibbons.<br/><br/>Group size has been reported to range from 4-8 individuals, with an average of 5.3-5.5 individuals, depending on the year of the study; during 2009-2011 the largest group comprised of 11 individuals (Mootnick <em>et al</em>. 2012). Like its closest congener the Cao Vit Gibbon (<em>Nomascus nasutus</em>), the Hainan Gibbon appears to be habitually polygynous with a bi-female breeding system (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016). Home range size was previously thought to be large for gibbons, with estimates between 2.0-9.87 km<sup>2</sup> (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989, Wei <em>et al</em>. 2004, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, recent standardised analysis has indicated that home range size is actually in line with closely related species, with an average home range of 1.49 km<sup>2</sup> (Bryant 2014, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016b, Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).

However, although core remaining habitat at Bawangling has been relatively well protected, poaching of other wildlife with rifles and traps continues to occur within the reserve, so this species is still potentially at threat from hunting activity (e.g. accidental shooting through mistaken identity).<br/><br/>The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Chan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Fellowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016). There are reports of a sex bias in births, but it is not possible to identify the sex of young Hainan gibbons in the field, because immature individuals do not differ in fur colouration or calls, and sexual organs of males and females resemble each other (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2006). However, recent genetic analysis has indicated that three out of four offspring born into one group in recent years were male (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Forest loss also remains a threat: between 1991 and 2008, remote sensing vegetation maps reported a decrease in gibbon habitat across Hainan by 540 km<sup>2</sup> (35%), and by 6.3 km<sup>2</sup> (7%) in the locality of the last remaining population at Bawangling National Nature Reserve. Forest patches suitable to support gibbons decreased from 754 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 316 km<sup>2</sup> in total area during this period, with plantations replacing forests below 760 m, and habitat becoming increasingly degraded (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987, 1989; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p>  </p>","<p>  </p><p>In the late 1950s, the population was estimated to be over 2,000 individuals (Haimoff 1984, Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987).

In 1998, the Bawangling population was thought to consist of 17 individuals (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2004). During a comprehensive survey in 2003, only 13 individuals were recorded, consisting of two groups, in addition to two solitary males (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005). Fellowes <em>et al</em>.

All mated females in the three previously known groups have produced infants roughly every two years, and all infants grew to adulthood except the death of the third group’s first neonates (B.

The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016; Bryant <em>et al.</em> 2015; Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005; Fellowes <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>  </p>",There are no records of this species in trade (live or dead).,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. At present it is only known to occur within Bawangling National Nature Reserve on Hainan (Chan<em> et al.</em> 2005, Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000, Turvey <em>et al.</em> 2015) and is the most threatened primate species in the world (Geissmann 2005). Suitable gibbon habitat exists more widely across the Bawangling landscape and also outside Bawangling, and there have been anecdotal reports of gibbon occurrence in various forested sites, such as Yinggeling National Nature Reserve, Jiaxi Nature Reserve and Limushan Nature Reserve (B. Chan unpubl. data, Turvey<em> et al</em>. 2016). Surveys have been conducted in some of these areas, but have not as yet detected any concrete evidence of any additional surviving gibbon individuals or populations (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Within Bawangling, past conservation efforts have focused on regular monitoring of the gibbon population, restoration of degraded lowland forest, and engagement of local villagers in conservation activities (Fellowes <em>et al.</em> 2008). Community work including public outreach and promotion of alternative livelihoods to lessen the villager's reliance on forest products and lands have also been initiated, however, there is a need for continued gun and trap confiscation around Bawangling. Following the 2014 conservation action planning meeting for the Hainan Gibbon (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015), current key conservation activities include: continued monitoring and development of optimal monitoring techniques to better understand gibbon dispersal, group formation and colonisation of new habitat; continued effective protection of gibbon habitat and enhancement of forest connectivity within and beyond the reserve, to promote expansion of gibbons into additional good-quality habitat; development of an emergency response plan in the event of a crisis situation; and improved communication to facilitate collaboration among stakeholders. Protection and restoration of adjoining lowland habitat is also necessary to allow longer-term expansion of the gibbon population, and enrichment planting of late successional gibbon food plant species in the species-poor secondary forest adjacent to current gibbon habitat is likely to constitute an important conservation action.<br/><br/>Captive breeding does not appear to be an appropriate strategy for this species in the short-term, because the population appears to be breeding at a healthy rate in the wild, and there are no individuals currently in captivity, with the cost of removing individuals from the current population (and potentially losing any individuals during capture) predicted to have adverse effects on <em>in situ</em> population survival (Bryant 2014, Bryant<em> et al.</em> in prep).</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

This species is confirmed from only one geographic locality, (trans-boundary between Vietnam and China), thus, its&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) reach critical thresholds, with habitat in the periphery being degraded (Rawson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013, Trịnh Đình Hoàn <em>et al</em>. 2016). Habitat is recovering within the core of their distribution. Improved surveys have determined that the population is not sufficiently small (i.e. has more than the minimum number of adult individuals) and/or is increasing, that is does not trigger small population size criteria as per last assessment. A trans-boundary population survey conducted in September 2007 recorded 18 groups with about 110 individuals (Rawson <em>et al.</em>, 2011) and is believed to be close to a full census. The survey approach was replicated in 2012, although only from listening posts in Vietnam, and returned at least 129 individuals in 24 groups (Nguyen The Cuong <em>et al</em>. 2012), suggesting that the population is increasing. However the main threat to this species, given its restricted range, is habitat loss and degradation (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Trịnh Đình Hoàn <em>et al.</em> 2016). What little remains of the species' habitat is under pressure from fuel wood collection, cultivation in valley bottoms and livestock grazing, especially of goats, by local Vietnamese and Chinese ethnic minorities. Hunting of this trans-boundary gibbon population has been controlled with the gazettement of protected areas in both Viet Nam and China and subsequent enforcement, although hunting of other taxa does still occur. It should be noted that even occasional hunting events of gibbons would be very detrimental to the species long-term viability and continued vigilance is required. Problems intrinsic to small, single populations may pose a significant long-term risk to population viability through inbreeding, disease outbreaks, extreme weather events and fires and climate change. A recent Population and&#160;Habitat Viability Analysis exercise by Fan <em>et al</em>. (2013) suggested that the last remaining population of these gibbons may be reaching carrying capacity, making habitat restoration a significant priority.</p>","<p>This species historically inhabited lower montane and limestone forests, in a wet tropical monsoon climate, at an altitude range of 50-900 m (Tien 1983). The known population is now entirely restricted to limestone forests on poorly accessible karst outcrops ranging between 500-930 m in elevation (Rawson<em> et al.</em> 2011). It is now restricted to the Cao Vit Gibbon Conservation Area, Viet Nam, and Bangliang Nature Reserve, China, which comprises a total of 2,500 ha of limestone forest straddling the Sino-Vietnamese border (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013a). The habitat in China has been severely degraded by various human activities and the average canopy height is only 10.5 m (Fei <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Though primarily frugivorous, the gibbon diet is made of: 36.1% of fruits, 21.9% of figs, 16.9% of leaves, 14.4% of buds, 7% animals, 3% flowers, 0.7% plant parts. Invertebrates and lizards form the 7% of animal part of the diet (Fei <em>et al</em>. 2012). In China, the gibbons were seen to feed on 81 species, however, only 19 species provided 77.8% of the diet (Fei <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). They prefer fruit when fruit is abundant, and eat a lot of leaves in lean seasons. They also increase resting and huddle together in sleeping places in cold months (Fei <em>et al.</em> 2012). These gibbons enter sleeping trees, on average, 88 minutes before sunset and leave, on average, 4 min after sunrise. They tend to sleep in relatively tall trees without lianas closer to ridges, choosing small branches close to the treetop. They usually move rapidly and straight to sleeping trees and keep silent once settled (Fei <em>et al.</em> 2012). Although these gibbons live in low karst forest, they display similar locomotion and feeding postures to gibbons living in tropical forest (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Yin <em>et al.</em> 2016). The fact the Cao-vit gibbon survives on karst forest probably does not mean that this gibbon is especially adapted to, or actually prefers, a karst forest over lowland forest, for instance. Rather, it appears that karst forest is more difficult to log and therefore is the last forest type standing in the original distribution area of the Cao-vit gibbon.<br/><br/>Similar to other gibbons, they tend to call in the early morning. On average, duets last 18.3 min and females produce 4.4 great calls per duet bout (Fan and Jiang 2010, Fei <em>et al</em>. 2010). Male calls showed great individuality and stability over a six year study period (Feng <em>et al</em>. 2014) They are diurnal and arboreal. Births mostly occur between October to February. The average home range of three focal groups was estimated at 130 ha (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2010), which is large for gibbons. They display a polygynous group structure of one adult male and one or two adult females with offspring. The average number of individuals in a group is approximately six (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p><p>      <span lang=""PT""></p>","<p>                      </p><p>  </p><p>The main threat to this species, given its restricted range, is habitat loss and degradation (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Hoàn <em>et al</em>. 2016).

This population was surveyed several times to determine its size and distribution (Rawson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Duc <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015), with each survey suggesting a slightly larger population than the last. In 2006, three more groups with 18 individuals were found on the Chinese side of the border (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008), confirming that this was a trans-boundary population.

Historically, <em>Nomascus nasutus</em> was distributed from southern China to northern Viet Nam, extending south to the Red River (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Bangliang Nature Reserve was upgraded to a national nature reserve in 2014.<br/><br/>A trans-boundary MoU has been signed (most recently in 2015) by Cao Bang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Viet Nam, and Quangxi Forestry Department, China, to improve trans-boundary coordination between protected area authorities. Meetings of patrol teams occur on a regular basis at the international border and government authorities convene every one to two years to discuss matters of mutual concern in addition to being available for immediate contact through other means on a case by case basis. For example, in 2015, Management Boards convened at the border to address the findings of Chinese hunters illegally entering the Vietnamese protected area. Both protected areas have active enforcement teams, including community-based conservation teams comprising local community members who are trained in patrol work.<br/><br/>Forest restoration activities, supported by FFI in China and PRCF in Viet Nam, aim to address the issue of forest degradation within the core areas of gibbon distribution. This involves both Assisted Natural Regeneration and reforestation activities. Activities relating to reduction of further impact on forest quality have also been conducted by FFI, including provision of fuel efficient stoves to reduce quantities of fuel wood extracted by local communities, cattle exclusion fencing, a goat buyback scheme and provision of elephant grass for silage to reduce grazing pressure on regenerating forests and replacement of timber waterwheels with metal waterwheels. In China,&#160; it has been proposed that strict conservation areas be imposed in areas close to gibbon habitat.<br/><br/>A trans-boundary conservation action plan is under development at the time of writing, based on stakeholder consultations at the village, provincial and international levels. This action plan will guide conservation interventions for the period of 2015-2020. Key activities will include: continued forest restoration to ensure the growing population will have suitable areas to expand into, continued measures to reduce further forest degradation, continued enforcement activities, increasing the size of the protected area and ensuring corridors to additional potential habitat, population and demographic monitoring and additional research activities such as genetic, habitat and viability analyses. Engaging local people in the buffer zones of the protected areas and provision of alternative livelihood options will also be key for addressing long-term impacts on the protected areas and the gibbons.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

With further data, this assessment may change.</p>","<em>Arctocubus aureus</em> occurs at low to medium elevations. Confined to vine tangles and areas with abundant young (or slow-growing) leafy stems in the understorey of moist evergreen, lowland rainforests and high deciduous forest, especially in tree-fall areas. The species also frequents plantations and farmland edges (Bearder <em>et al. </em>2003, Nekaris 2013). Large vertical branches are never climbed because the small, narrow hands and feet of this species are adapted only to close around stems less than 6 cm in diameter, preferring dense vegetation as it provides continuous walkways. This species avoids climbing higher than 15 m (it mostly lives below 5 m) due to heightened competition from birds, less consistent insect resources, more exposure to wind, sun and predators, and fewer thin-branched tangles to shelter in (Nekaris &amp; Bearder 2011). <em>Arctocebus aureus</em> uses tree forks and dense tangles of vegetation as sleeping sites, sleeping singly except for mothers with infants (Bearder <em>et al.</em> 2003, Nekaris 2013). Dietary staples are invertebrates, and they frequently descend to the forest floor to forage on insects and fallen fruits (Ambrose 2013). Caterpillars of all species are eaten, including hairy and distasteful species that are avoided by other insect-predators. The females give birth to one infant twice per year (Ambrose 2013, Nekaris 2013).","Clear-felling and large-scale clearances are the only major threat to the habitat of&#160;<em>Arctocebus aureus</em>. This species has previously been considered too small and cryptic to face much danger from human predation; however, as other wildlife decline, hunting pressure on smaller mammals is increasing, and angwantibos have featured in bushmeat reports from Republic of Congo and DRC, although in small quantities, and in the trade for traditional practices in Republic of Congo (Svensson <em>et al.</em> 2015).","This cryptic species is considered rare in Gabon, where densities of 2 individuals/km² were found in dense primary forest and 7&#160;individuals/km² in thickets in secondary forest (Charles-Dominique 1977). Normal census methods are difficult to use because the&#160;Golden Angwantibo&#160;hides its head and eyes at the least disturbance.",Unknown,"<em>Arctocebus aureus</em> is endemic to western Central Africa and may occur from the Sanaga River in Cameroon, through Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Congo to the Congo River/Ubangi River in Central African Republic, but with a very localised and patchy distribution.

17969996,2054,Arctocebus calabarensis,Near Threatened,A2cd,2019,2016-08-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although historically this species persisted quite well in degraded secondary forest, given continued major habitat destruction across most of its geographic range, and increasing hunting pressure on small-bodied animals as larger species are driven to extinction, the Calabar Angwantibo has been recognised as justifying at least Near Threatened status. It is estimated to have lost at least 20% of its habitat in the last 10-15 years (about three generations, based on a generation length of 4.6 years given by Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013); based on this habitat loss, it is suspected that the population size has also declined by at least 20% over the last three generations. More research is required to establish whether this species qualifies for a threatened category.","<p>The Calabar Angwantibo is most often found in areas of dense, low undergrowth with abundant lianas and vines below 5 m in the understorey of primary and secondary rainforest; it particularly favours the growth that springs up in clearings, trees falls, and along forest edges (Jewell and Oates 1969). Therefore, wherever it is already established, small-scale forest clearance, selective tree-felling and road-making probably favour this species. In such areas it can becomes relatively abundant in thickets and patches of dense secondary growth. Its diet is invertebrates and fruits; based on the ecology of its sister taxon <em>Arctocebus aureus</em> in Gabon, it is likely that caterpillars form an important part of its diet. This species is able to produce two single young in a year, with a minimum inter-birth interval of about 4.5 months (Oates and Ambrose 2013).</p>","The biggest threats to the Calabar Angwantibo are the clearance of forest for cultivation, as well as some hunting for meat. Although this species can adapt to low-level habitat disturbance (if some dense undergrowth remains and inter-tree distances are not too great), major forest conversion to intensive and/or industrial agriculture is likely to eliminate it because of its weak capacity to disperse. Such forest destruction is increasing dramatically in many parts of its range, and especially in eastern Nigeria, as the human population continues to grow and economic development intensifies. For instance, in the period 1990–2015, Nigeria suffered an estimated 59.4% loss of forest cover, while the loss in Cameroon was 22.6%; in 1990–2000 the rate of forest loss was 2.7% per annum in Nigeria compared with 0.9% per annum in Cameroon, but in 2010–2015 these rates had increased to 5.0% per annum in Nigeria 1.1% per annum in Cameroon (FAO 2015). As other wildlife has declined, hunting pressure on smaller mammals has increased, and angwantibos now feature in many bushmeat reports (Svensson and Friant 2014, Svensson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). In some areas they may also be killed when encountered because they are considered a bad omen (E.L. Gadsby pers. comm. 2016), and they feature in small quantities in trade as pets and for body parts (Svensson and Friant 2014, Svensson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).","The Calabar Angwantibo is a cryptic species that can be locally abundant within its patchy distribution. In southeastern Nigeria in the 1960s it was encountered at a rate of 0.7 individuals per km (Jewell and Oates 1969). Originally, angwantibos were probably adapted to tree-fall gaps in the forest and to forest edges (Charles-Dominique 1977); as high forest has suffered increasing anthropogenic disturbance, habitats resembling tree-fall gaps and forest edge have become more widespread. However, with forest disturbance by humans in Nigeria and Cameroon giving way to wholesale forest clearance, and hunting pressure increasing, populations of Calabar Angwantibos are almost certainly declining.",Decreasing,The Calabar Angwantibo has a very patchy and localised distribution within the lowland rainforest block between the Niger River and the Sanaga River in eastern Nigeria and western Cameroon.,This species is hunted for meat.,Terrestrial,"<a name=""_GoBack""></a>This species is listed as Class B under the African Convention, and under Appendix II of CITES.

The exploitation of the species appears to be particularly high in Cambodia with researchers reporting no <em>N. bengalensis </em>present at most sites (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The release of slow lorises confiscated from the illegal pet trade with little or no rehabilitation is a threat to all slow loris species, as is translocation from human-dominated landscapes into forests, to which individuals of the species may not be adapted (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2014, Starr and Nekaris 2015).

According to local people, slow lorises are rarely seen in this area and are not easy to find. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, no specific nation-wide population survey on this species has been carried out, but a 2015 survey team encountered 34 Bengal slow lorises (18-night survey) in Satchari National Park of Sylhet division. A one-night survey in Lawachara National Park revealed three individuals (S.C. Rahman, pers. comm). The species was also recorded in Rema-Kalenga&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Feeroz <em>et al</em>, 2011) and Rajkandi Reserve Forest of Sylhet area (M. Foysal, T. Khan, pers.comm). Feeroz (2013) reported <em>N. bengalensis </em>as being rare in Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary of Chittagong region. All of these forests are semi- evergreen. A photography record is available from Kaptai National Park, Rangamati Hill District under Chittagong division (S.R. Rahul, pers. comm.). Beside these records, since 2010, several Bengal Slow Lorises were taken from human habitation in Jamalpur, Sherpur and Mymensingh district. These districts have some deciduous forests and are connected with Meghalaya state of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan Choudhury (2008) reports that Bengal slow loris habitat is mostly tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in the foothills up to 300 m. The species has been indirectly recorded in the possession of woodcutters in four dzongkhags including Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkar, Sarpang and Zemgang. From this, Choudhury inferred that they should occur in Royal Manas National Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Wangchuk&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004) wrote that lorises also occur in Chukha and Samchi districts, but did not say on what evidence. The existing records indicate that the Sankosh River is the western limit for the species in Bhutan as well as Assam.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, some researchers report the population to occur potentially in large forest tracts (R. Timmins pers. comm). Duckworth (1994) and Ratajszczak (1998), however, both reported the species as being very rare in Lao PDR, with the former reporting abundance indices of about 0.30-0.65/km at sites including: Central Laos (Phou Xang He, NakaiNam Theun, Xe Piang, Muang Hom, Nam Kading, Nam Ao, Bang Navang) and South Laos (Xe Namoy). In 2000, published data from 1994-1995 recorded <em>N. bengalensis </em>frequency as “common” in some forests (Phou Khaokhoay NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, and Bolavens Northeast PPA), whereas they were encountered “occasional” in others (Nakai Plateau) (Evans, et al., 2000, Streicher, 2014). A single record comes from Southern Laos in Xe Kaman lowlands in Dong Ampham NBCA, Attapu Province&#160; (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the populations are severely reduced and have disappeared from many forests (Fitch-Snyder and Thanh 2002; V. Thanh pers. comm). Surveys carried out in northern Viet Nam at Na Hang Nature Reserve in 2013 recorded a density of 0.09 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data). Recent surveys of N. bengalensis in Central Vietnam at Bach Ma National Park returned no animals in 30.4 km of surveys (Blair, unpublished data). A large population with a phenotype of the Cambodian forms occurs on Phu Quoc island in the Gulf of Thailand (Huaong and Blair, pers. comm). Surveys in 2014 in Phu Quoc Island recorded a density of 0.38 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Cambodia the species is very rare and has only been seen west of the Mekong River in Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Kulen National Park at 22.5-25.0 animals per km2 (Starr et al., 2010). Observations of recently hunted animals were made in Preah Vihear Protection Forest, Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Tbeng (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2011). Starr <em>et al</em>. (2010) failed to detect this species in Bokor National Park and Cardamoms Protected Forest; they also did not detect it east of the Mekong (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri PF); Coudrat et al. also could not find this species east of the Mekong at the following sites: Mondulkiri (Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Pritch Wildlife Sanctuary) or Ratanakiri (Vonsei District, Virachey National Park, Seima Protection Forest, Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary). Other surveyors in Cambodia have noted the presence of the species in a number of community forests (Eam Sam Un, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Bengal slow loris is thought to be widespread (W. Brockelman pers. comm.) but has never been surveyed specifically.&#160; It is known from Khao Yai National Park. Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. (2010) found that the species is absent from many forests, and occurs at very low densities when present. In plantation forest in Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, they recorded Bengal slow lories at a density of 0.64 individuals/km (Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>In China, surveys have been carried out since 2013. Bengal Slow Loris habitat is mostly primary evergreen broad-leaf forest up to 2,200 m. The population occurs in counties of western and southwestern Yunnan (Yingjiang, Longchuan, Ruili, Tengchong, Mangshi, Zhenkang, Cangyuan, Gengma, Yongde, Shuangjiang, Ximeng, Lancang, Menglian, Menghai, Mengla), even in secondary forests and agricultural plantations (Ni, pers. comm.). Survey in Cangyuan recorded a density of 0.33 individuals/km (Ni, unpublished data). In southern and southeastern Yunnan, Bengal slow loris is mostly distributed in scattered nature reserves as follows: Yuanjiang, Amushan, Guanyinshan, Huanglianshan, Fenshuiling, Daweishan, Laojunshan, Gulinqing, Laoshan. The populations are severely reduced and have possibly disappeared from southwest of Guangxi Province (Ni, per. comm.). Suitable habitat, also containing gibbons, can be found in many nature reserves, where the species is likely present but still to be confirmed, including Nanguanhe, Ailaoshan, Xishuangbanna, Nabanhe, Wenshan in Yuannan; and Bangliang in Guangxi.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in Bangladesh, Cambodia West of the Mekong River, China (southern and western Yunnan and possibly in southwestern Guangxi), north-eastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand north of the Isthmus of Kra, and Viet Nam.</p>","The species is&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">hunted and traded for (i) food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pets (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V.

It is nocturnal, and almost entirely arboreal.

The diet of the Philippines slow loris consists primarily of sap, insects and small vertebrates. They have been observed eating fruits but only on rare occasions. In Sabah, Stark (unpublished data) found that the Philippine slow loris regularly slept in dense trees characterised by lianas and climbers, choosing many sleeping trees, reusing them only a few times.     </span></p>","<span class=""None"">Burning of habitat and conversion, especially to palm oil plantations, almost certainly represents a threat to this species. Although it is relatively adaptable to anthropogenic habitats, and so it might less affected by forest loss than some other primate species, forest loss has been so severe in the region that it is likely to have had some negative impacts. The species is collected locally for use as pets; subsequent uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also a threat. Captured wild animals are also used as tourist attraction in some hotels or tourist camps in Borneo (Miard unpublished). Forest fires of 2015 on Borneo have been the worst since 2004, and acres of forest has been burned, leading to a significant decrease in the habitat of this species.

However, loris ""presence"" is usually not determined first-hand (Chivers and Burton 1988, Indrawan and Rangkuti 2001), and it also cannot be presumed that lorises still occur in areas from where they were once collected. The species actually seems to be very uncommon throughout its range. It has a very limited distribution in the Philippines (Dagosto and Gebo 1995, Heaney&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998). In Kalimantan, a 3-month survey in a protected peat swamp forest (Sabangau National Park) revealed very low densities of slow lorises, 0.21 - 0.38 animals/km (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). When comparing this to other studies of <em>Nycticebus</em>, it seems clear that this species, when it does occur, is rare. Indeed, in 46,000 trapping nights in Kinabalu National Park, Wells&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004) trapped this species only three times, and noted that in nocturnal walks over five years, it was rarely seen. The species was found to occur at an encounter rate of 0.12 individuals/km at Danau Girang Field Center in Sabah, Malaysia (Munds 2014).

Wild sightings of <em>N. coucang</em> are rare in southern Thailand (Osterberg and Nekaris 2015). In peninsular Malaysia <em>N. coucang</em> is largely found in tropical rain forest, dipterocarp forests, isolated forest patches adjacent to plantations, swamp forest, unlogged and selectively logged primary forest (Nekaris 2014; Barrett 1984; Wiens <em>et al</em>. 2006).

In captivity, however, the species can be housed socially and makes a wide array of contact calls, including a mother infant call unique to this species (Nekaris, unpublished). Exudates make up as much as 43 percent of this species’ diet; they consume animal prey, fruits, leaves, and bird eggs to make up remainder (Streicher <em>et al.</em> 2012; Weins <em>et al.</em> 2006). <em>N. coucang </em>are venomous, as are other members of the <em>Nycticebus</em> genus (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013).    </span></p>","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This species is collected for use as pets, and the animals are sold throughout Southeast Asia (Nekaris and Bearder 2011; Nekaris and Nijman 2007).

Well-meaning rescue centres haphazardly reintroduce lorises into local forests without knowledge of their taxonomy or social needs (Nekaris and Starr, 2015). Sumatran populations are particularly impacted by the pet trade. The species is relatively adaptable to anthropogenic habitats, and so it might less affected by forest loss than some other primate species.

An examination of faeces broadened the diet, including plant parts, small<span class=""apple-converted-space"">‐<span class=""apple-converted-space"">sized arthropods (primarily Coleoptera and Lepidoptera), reptile scales, animal bones (bats), and animal hairs. Streicher (2005) found that released pygmy loris had a diet comprised of insects (40%) and gums (30%), with the remainder comprising unidentified plant exudates (Streicher 2005).

They are believed to treat more than 100 diseases, including to regain strength after childbirth, stomach problems, healing wounds and broken bones, and in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Their market value has more than doubled in the last 15 years, pointing towards reduced numbers in the wild (Starr, <em>et al</em>., 2010).

In addition to their ecological range restrictions, their distribution along rivers makes them relatively more vulnerable to human impact. They are highly specialized seed predators, with immature seeds and fruits comprising the bulk of the diet. Uacaris live in large multi-male, multi-female groups with a fission-fusion social organization. Specialist habitat and feeding requirements may mean greater sensitivity to habitat modification. While other pitheciines (<em>Chiropotes</em> and <em>Pithecia</em>) have demonstrated a degree of tolerance and adaptability in the face of habitat disturbance, the capacity of uacaris to cope with anthropogenic disturbance is unknown.<br/><br/><strong><em>Cacajao calvus calvus</em><br/></strong>This taxon is a habitat specialist that is primarily limited to flooded forests such as the lower Rio Juruá or the white-water várzea habitats of the low Rio Japurú.

The distribution along rivers may make this taxon relatively more vulnerable to human impact, while specialist habitat and feeding requirements may result in greater sensitivity to habitat disturbance. <br/><br/><strong><em>Cacajao calvus calvus</em></strong><br/>Although this subspecies is rarely hunted in its range because its appearance is considered too human-like (Ayres 1986), the main threat facing this primate is the reduction and transformation of its flooded forest habitat. The main forms of deforestation in the area, are small-scale agriculture and logging (Ayres and Johns 1987). Current data indicate that almost the entire (confirmed) population are included within the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve and population densities appear to have increased in the 20 years up to 2005 (Ayres 1986, Paim 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Cacajao calvus rubicundus</em><br/></strong>This species is hunted for food. It may be affected by habitat loss due to logging and forest loss especially along the main stream of the Amazon. <br/><br/><strong><em>Cacajao calvus ucayalii</em><br/></strong>Surveys conducted between 1979 and 1986 (Aquino 1988) showed that the range was much reduced, hunting having exterminated the species in several areas. Aquino (1988) suggests that populations close to the Ucayali and Amazon Rivers have been greatly reduced and in some areas exterminated, caused by hunting and habitat disturbance. The Yavarí River and its tributary the Yaquerana represent the stronghold for remaining populations. Close to Iquitos, <em>Mauritia flexuosa</em> is extracted in large quantities by felling the palms (Bodmer <em>et al.</em> 1999, Meyer and Penn 2003); the unsustainable extraction of this resource may have an impact on <em>Cacajao c. ucayalii</em> in some areas (Bowler 2007). Logging concessions designated in 2004 cover around one-third of the geographic range of <em>Cacajao c. ucayalii</em>. While the selective removal of low-density, high-value timber species does not appear likely to have a great impact on populations of <em>Cacajao c. ucayalii</em>, the logging operations increase human populations and bushmeat hunting in remote parts of the range (Bowler 2007). Hunting levels on the Yavarí-Mirín and Yavarí have increased since 2004, when human populations increased due to logging activities. Bodmer <em>et al</em>.

Sites on the Yavarí and Yavarí-Mirín have some of the highest densities of (Puertas and Bodmer 1993; Salovaara <em>et al.</em> 2003). Jorge and Velazco (2006) discovered some new populations on the upper Tapiche River and on the Divisor ridges in the Zona Reservada Sierra del Divisor.",Decreasing,"This species is found in Brazil and Peru. The distribution of the Bald-headed Uacari is poorly known and field surveys are needed to resolve a series of issues related to the distribution and taxonomy of these taxa. Available data suggest that there is no range overlap among the subspecies of <em>Cacajao calvus</em>, although there may be a contact zone between <em>Cacajao calvus calvus</em> and <em>Cacajao calvus rubicundus</em> (Ayres 1986).<br/><br/>Global Forest Watch data from the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Acre and the Peruvian departments of Loreto and Ucayali, in which the species occurs, suggests that, should ongoing rates of forest loss continue, between 10-15% of the forest within this species’ range is likely to be lost by the middle of this century.<br/><br/><em>Cacajao calvus calvus</em> has a restricted range, from the confluence of the rios Japurá and Solimões north-west between the two rivers connecting to either the Paraná Yaula, or the Furo or Paraná da Aranapa in Brazil (Hershkovitz 1987). Until recently, the White Bald-headed Uacari was considered endemic to Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, but observations indicate the presence of this taxon in the region of the lower Juruá (Vira Volta), south of the Solimões (Silva Jr. pers. comm.). A new population of white uacaris was recorded from the Rio Jurupari, a tributary of the Rio Envira in the state of Amazons, about 750 km to south-west of the current range (Silva Jr. pers. comm.), and another sighting along the Alto Jurupari south of the town Feijó in the state of Acre (L. Veiga pers. comm.), but it has not yet been confirmed whether or not these are the same or distinct taxa (see Figueiredo 2006). Unlike most other Amazonian platyrrhines, uacaris tend to range along rivers rather than within interfluvia; várzea forests connect the two populations along the rivers between these two areas. No field data are available to determine if these populations are allopatric. The subspecies <em>Cacajao c. novaesi</em> occurs in the middle of these two populations (Silva, Jr. and Martins 1999). <br/><br/>The geographic range of <em>Cacajao c. novaesi</em> has been updated since first described by Hershkoivitz (1987) when it was thought to occur only on the south bank of the upper rio Juruá between the Rios Tarauacá and Eirú. Peres (1988, 1997) extended its range north-east of the range described by Hershkovitz (1987), on the left bank of the Juruá and at Lago da Fortuna, Carauari to the north. Populations of <em>Cacajao calvus</em> observed by Peres on the upper Juruá, and unconfirmed reports by Fernandes (1990) in the Brazilian state of Acre on the upper Juruá and Purus, are either of <em>Cacajao calvus novaesi</em> or <em>Cacajao calvus ucayalii</em>, which would extend the known ranges of either of these subspecies (Bowler 2007).<br/> <br/><em>Cacajao c. rubicundus</em> occurs in Brazil, with a relatively restricted (poorly known) range. It presents an apparent disjunct geographic distribution, known from an area situated in the Iça-Solimões interfluve in Amazonas (type locality: opposite the town of São Paulo de Olivença, north bank of the Solimões [Hershkovitz 1987]), and another near the mouth of the Auati-Paraná. <em>Cacajao c. rubicundus</em> also occurs south of the Solimões, west of the Jutaí River at the Jutaí-Solimões Ecological Station (Nogueira-Neto 1992). It may have formerly occurred in the Trapezium of Colombia, but if they did they are now believed to be extirpated.<br/><br/><em>Cacajao c. ucayalii</em> is found south of the Amazon River in Peru between the Ucayali and Yavarí Rivers. In the past, its range probably extended as far as the Urubamba River (Hershkovitz 1987), but surveys undertaken in the 1980s suggest that the southern limit is now the Sheshea River (Aquino 1988). Hershkovitz (1987) claimed this taxon also occurs on the east bank of the lower Yavarí in Brazil. The subspecies has a patchy distribution. It may no longer be present on the Brazilian side of the Yavarí, and is absent from a long stretch on the Peruvian side, upriver from the mouth of the Yavarí-Mirín perhaps as far as Quebrada Curacinha close to the town of Colonia Angamos (Salovaara <em>et al.</em> 2003). On the Yavarí-Mirín, the species is present on a large of the North bank, but is absent from the south side of the river, except in the upper reaches. As noted earlier, populations of <em>Cacajao calvus</em> observed by Peres on the upper Juruá and unconfirmed reports by Fernandes (1990) in the Brazilian state of Acre on the upper Juruá and Purus, may be either of <em>Cacajao calvus novaesi</em> or <em>Cacajao calvus ucayalii</em>, which would extend the known ranges of either of these subspecies (Silva Jr.and Martins 1999).",This species is hunted. Hunting is reported to be heavy in parts of this species’ range.,Terrestrial,"This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. The Primate Protection Centre (Centro de Proteção de Primatas Brasileiros: ICM/CPB ), of the Federal Environmental Protection Institute (Instituto Chico Mendes), supports and coordinates primate conservation programmes throughout Brazil. An international committee (Comitê Internacional para Conservação e Manejo dos Primatas Amazônicos) was established by the the CPB and Instituto Chico Mendes (ICM) to discuss and define actions for the conservation of Amazonian primate taxa, and together with the members of the Pitheciine Action Group (PAG), is currently developing Conservation Action Plans for each of the four subspecies in Brazil. <br/><br/>A decree (No. 34-2004-AG) was published by the Peruvian government in 2004 that approves the categorization of threatened Peruvian wildlife and prohibits hunting, capturing, owning, transporting, and exportation for commercial purposes. It is hoped that this will help in conservation actions and stimulate research on threatened Peruvian wildlife (Heymann 2004).<br/><br/><strong><em>Cacajao calvus calvus</em></strong><br/>This subspecies  is protected within the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve (Ayres <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/> <br/><strong><em>Cacajao calvus novaesi</em><br/></strong>Afforded some protection within two extractive reserves, the Middle Juruá and the Upper Juruá, where hunting and the exploitation of natural resources are permitted.<br/><br/><strong><em>Cacajao calvus rubicundus</em></strong><br/><em>Cacajao c. rubicundus</em> should be relatively well protected as it occurs within the Jutaí-Solimões Ecological Station (284,285 ha), south of the rio Solimões (Nogueira-Neto 1992).<br/><br/><strong><em>Cacjao calvus ucayalii</em></strong><br/>Until recently, the only protected area known to contain <em>C. c ucayalii</em> was the regional Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Communal Reserve (TTCR). The TTCR extends over an area of 322,500 ha, and is situated close to the city of Iquitos in upland forests between the Amazon and the Yavarí (Newing and Bodmer 2004). The reserve was created as a result of a strong alliance between local people and conservationists. The presence of <em>Cacajao calvus ucayalii</em> has become part of the justification for three areas either under proposal or newly created. These are the Sierra del Divisor Reserved Zone, the Lago Preto Conservation Concession (LPCC) and the proposed Greater Yavarí Reserve. Community conservation work is conducted by WCS-Peru and the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology on the Yavari and Yavari-Mirin Rivers in Peru. This project aims to reduce the hunting of <em>C. c. ucayalii</em> in this area (Bowler 2007).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Where they do overlap, certain core areas have been observed which are used more or less exclusively by one family group (Tilson and Tenaza 1976; Watanabe 1981); intrusion into these areas by others is habitually followed by aggressive behaviour incl. vocalization (Tilson and Tenaza 1976). Siberut Langurs exhibit a large repertoire of vocalizations, e.g. alarm calls, duetting, distraction display calls, contact calls etc. For the purpose of sleeping, the animal generally retreats to specific trees (often tall emergents) which are located in the species’ core area (Tilson and Tenaza 1976).</p><p>Siberut Langurs feed predominantly on fruit, followed by leaves, and – to a much lesser extent – on flowers and other items (Hadi 2012); for a colobine, their diet is unusually frugivorous.

Hunting pressure has increased in recent years as a result of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Furthermore, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been progressively eroded due to missionary and state influences (Whittaker 2006; Quinten <em>et al</em>. 2014). Interview surveys in 50 villages on Siberut revealed that 24 % of the respondents were ‘active hunters’ and 68% of those respondents target <em>Presbytis siberu</em>.

They can be found in disturbed habitats and in fragments with secondary forest, but as seed predators of large forest tree species (notably of the family Lecythidaceae), they tend to be in higher densities in mature forest. One possible explanation for their very large geographic distribution as a genus and as a species is their ability to use a range of forest types, from várzea to igapó to terra firma (Marsh 2014).<br/><br/>Sakis are the smallest of the pitheciines, but are larger than other non-prehensile-tailed platyrrhines (<em>Aotus</em>, <em>Saimiri</em>, <em>Callicebus </em>and the Callitrichinae). Adults weigh 1.5–4.0 kg, but show a wide range in total body length (250–980 mm) and tail length (255–545 mm), reflecting the diversity between different taxa. Their tails are usually as long as the body, but in many species tails can be longer (&gt;100 mm; based on museum specimen data) in males and females. Size dimorphism is not striking but, depending on the species, females tend to be lighter in weight and smaller in overall size. Sakis are characterized by their long, coarse, fluffy hair that easily piloerects when they are approached in the wild, making them look bigger than they actually are. The hairs on the tail tend to be longer than on the back, but this varies among species, and the tail hair also ‘puffs up’ as a threat. Hairs on the trunk are always longer than those on the forearms and hind limbs. Underbellies are very lightly covered or bare. Coronal hairs are directed forward as a hood, and, depending on the species, overlap the facial region making them appear to have ‘bangs’. Both males and females have distinct throat glands for scent marking, with varying development depending on the species. Some males have obvious neck folds but others only a bare skin patch. Sakis are frugivorous seed predators (sakis are morphologically specialized for seed predation), but they eat insects such as army ants, as well as spiders, and other arthropods. Otherwise, their diet comprises seeds, fruit pulp, young leaves, insects and flowers. They vocalize in grunts, chirps, whistles, and low calls, but can be exceptionally quiet when sneaking away from a perceived threat such as a field researcher.<br/><br/>Movement Patterns: Locomotion consists of quadrupedal walking/ running, climbing and leaping. Members of this genus form small groups (2-9 individuals) which in some species may resemble a loose “fission-fusion” (Marsh pers. observ.) but core groups generally comprise a single male-female breeding pair and several young.

The status of this species varies in different parts of its range, but overall this decline is expected to continue in the future.","<p>This species is found in high-altitude cedar and oak forests, coastal scrub, and overgrazed rocky slopes with vestigial vegetation. It is confined to inaccessible rocky areas, gorges, and montane areas (from sea level up to approximately 2,600 m asl) due to habitat use conflicts with humans in more favourable areas. All the areas occupied by the Barbary Macaque are under growing pressure from human activity and habitat availability for <em>M. sylvanus</em> has decreased markedly in recent decades (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). <br/><br/>In Algeria, occupied habitats include mixed cedar (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>) and oak forests; Humid Zen Oak (<em>Quercus canariensis</em>) and Cork Oak (<em>Quercus suber</em>) mixes; Algerian Fir (<em>Abies numidica</em>), cedar and Zen Oak mixed forests; and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Taub 1977b, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Moroccan habitats include high cedar forests (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>), cedar/Holm Oak (<em>Quercus ilex</em>) mixtures, mixed oak forests (Qu<em>ercus suber, Q. canariensis, Q. ilex </em>and<em> Q. pyrenaica</em>) and cliffs and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Waters 2013). In habitats with cedar, macaques can reach densities of 25–40 individuals per km² or greater, whereas in habitats without cedar much lower densities of 5–7 individuals per km² are reported (Fa 1984). Densities in the mixed oak forests of Bouhachem Natural Reserve appear to be much higher than previously reported for the region (Waters unpublished data). In all occupied habitats, there is a species of oak available.<br/><br/>In Algeria, <em>M. sylvanus</em> lives in mixed-sex groups of up to 80 individuals with a modal size of 40 individuals (Ménard 2002). In Morocco, in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve, group size of four study groups was 52–73 with a mean of 62 (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Middle Atlas Mountains, group size ranged between 14 and 54 animals with a mean of 25 (Majolo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Life span in the wild is known to be up to 22 years (Lindenfors 2002). Females reach sexual maturity between 3.5 and 4 years of age and males between 4.5 and 7 years of age. In the wild, average age at first birth is 5.3 years for females (Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996; Lindenfors 2002) and the interbirth interval is 1.3 years (Taub 1974 in Fa 1984, Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996).</p>","<p>The destruction and degradation of the Barbary Macaque’s forest habitat is the most serious threat to the species. The severity of different threats varies in different parts of the species' range. <br/><br/>Severe habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation have been caused by domestic and industrial consumption of wood, use of fire, clearing for cultivation and overgrazing by sheep and goat herds (Taub 1977a, Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Ménard and Vallet 1993). This is exacerbated by poor forestry management; often <em>Cedrus atlanticus</em> is favoured and efforts are made to reduce <em>Quercus ilex</em>, but the latter species is a crucial resource for Barbary Macaques in some areas of their distribution (Ménard and Vallet 1986, 1996). In Morocco, severe habitat loss is also caused by extensive logging of cedar trees, occurring within and outside national parks (B. Majolo pers. obs. 2014).<br/><br/>As well as habitat degradation resulting from overgrazing by livestock is a major threat to the species (and a problem which is exacerbated by drought), in recent years, shepherds have increasingly settled near water sources. As shepherd tribes move into the forest, they often enclose open water sources with cement wells to be able to extract water for their herds. As a result, Barbary Macaques and other wildlife have been excluded from water sources in areas where it was previously accessible to them (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Conflicts with local people have been reported in Algeria, as a result of crop-raiding by macaques (e.g., villages in Djurdjura National Park in the Grande-Kabylie region: F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Crop raiding by Barbary Macaques has been reported by farmers in the area of Ouzoud (El Alami and Chait 2014) and other areas of the High Atlas. As a consequence, the shooting of Barbary Macaques as a result of crop raiding and cedar bark stripping was reported by Deag (1977) and must be seen as an ongoing threat to the species’ future.<br/><br/>In Algeria, national park officials indicate that the primary problem faced by Barbary Macaques is the conflict with mountain settlers, agricultural farmers and crop producers. Recently, regulation of forest use and access in Algeria has changed and it is now easier for people to use the forest areas. During the 1980s and 1990s, Algerians faced public curfews and restricted access to mountainous/forested regions due to civil war. Until recently, settlers were allowed to return to homes once occupied by their relatives in areas where Barbary Macaques are present. For example, in Chréa National Park, the human population increased from 550–600 individuals in 1993 to over 6,000 in 2015. Growth in human populations has resulted in a rise in infrastructure development in and around these areas, increasing the chances of macaque and human interaction through crop raiding, feeding interactions, as well as vehicle accidents (Benrabah 2015). Development of infrastructure has been shown to negatively impact wild macaques. For example, between 2008 and 2015, 31 incidents were recorded by park officials in Chréa National Park, including vehicle-related deaths of macaques (12 incidents) and 11 attempts of illegal capture of wild monkeys (Benrabah 2015). <br/><br/>The illegal live primate trade is also a significant threat to Barbary Macaques, as is their exploitation as photo props in tourist areas. Reports of capture for the international pet trade date back to 1977 (Deag 1977), and since then the trade has increased markedly (van Lavieren 2004). The Barbary Macaque was the most commonly confiscated mammal recorded by breeding programmes in European zoos between 2006–2010 (Zimmerman 2011). Infant <em>M. sylvanus</em> are offered both openly and covertly for sale on markets across Morocco, and prices of up to 200 Euros per animal have been recorded (van Lavieren 2004). Prices of about 100 Euros per animal have been recorded in Algeria, with Chaabet-el-Akhra gorges (Béjaïa) and Yakouren (Akfadou) cited as critical locations where illegal trade occur (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Additional threats include persecution, predation by dogs (Waters 2014), unmanaged primate tourism (Marechal <em>et al</em>. 2011, Borg <em>et al</em>. 2014), and pollution of the wadis (rivers) associated with forests (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Barbary Macaques seem to be rarely used for food, except as noted in some old reports in Algeria (Deag 1977).</p>","<p>In 1975, the Moroccan population of Barbary Macaques was estimated to be about 17,000 (Taub 1975). In Algeria, the population was estimated at 5,500 animals around 40 years ago (Taub 1977a). Alhough Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. (1999) estimated the species at around 15,000 individuals in 1999, this estimate was based on incomplete data.<br/><br/>Two population surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 at 23 locations in Algeria estimated the Algerian population to be 1,336–3,506 animals (Benrabah 2015, Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), representing an average population decrease of 50% in comparison to the last published survey (Fa 1984). Algerian subpopulations are highly fragmented (Fa 1984, Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). In 1999, just seven widely separated isolated populations existed, whereas 35 years ago they were found in at least six additional locations in Algeria (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). Currently, in Algeria there is a remaining isolated population in Gorge Chiffa and the Park National of Chrea (131–352 individuals) (Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). The populations of Djurdjura, Tikjda, Akhfasou, Bejaia, Gouraya, Yakouoren, Kherrata, Draguina, Taza, Ait Alouane, Guerrouch and el Babor are fragmented.<br/><br/>In Morocco, a number of surveys have documented marked declines in population density, along with losses of a number of sites (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999, Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). Fourteen isolated populations were identified in the High Atlas (Cuzin 2003). A recent survey in the Central High Atlas Mountains reported direct observations of 644 individuals in 23 groups with a mean group size of 21 individuals. However, irregular surveys over a long period may have resulted in an overestimate of the population (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The cedar forest area of the central Middle Atlas represents the largest refuge of the North African forest ecosystem. In the 1980s, it was estimated that 65–75% of the world's remaining population of <em>Macaca sylvanus</em> lived in this area (Camperio Ciani 1986). In the mid-1970s, population densities in the central Middle Atlas cedar forest were variously estimated at 60–70 individuals per km² (Deag 1974) or 43 per km² (Taub 1975). The most recent population estimate for the Middle Atlas is 5,000 macaques with densities of up to 23.4 individuals per km² (Menard <em>et al</em> 2013a). These data indicate that, in the central Middle Atlas, average population density is three times less than it was 30 years ago (<em>ca</em> 15,000; Taub 1977). In addition, Menard <em>et al</em>. (2013b) estimated that 46% of immatures were removed from macaque groups habituated for tourism in Ifrane National Park by poachers for the pet trade.<br/><br/>In the Rif Mountains, recent and current surveys are revealing that the populations are not as fragmented and low as previously thought. A recent survey has estimated a population of ~1,500 macaques in contiguous mixed oak forest in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve where there is very little poaching pressure for the pet trade (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>On Gibraltar, the population is maintained at <em>ca</em> 300 animals but now occurs in more and smaller groups. Some of these groups often range in built-up areas and have caused serious conflict with residents. One such group has been captured and sent to a captive collection in the UK (Waters 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Barbary Macaque is the only surviving primate in Africa north of the Sahara Desert, the only native species of primate to occur in Europe, and the only member of the genus <em>Macaca</em> that can be found outside Asia. In prehistoric times, this species inhabited Southern Europe and all of North Africa (Delson 1980, Camperio Ciani 1986). In historic times, it was widespread throughout North Africa from Libya to Morocco, but its current distribution is limited to small relict patches of forest and scrub in Algeria and Morocco (Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Scheffrahn <em>et al</em>. 1993, Menard and Vallet 1996). A semi-wild population lives in Gibraltar, which is a long established introduced population (Fa 1981, von Starck 1990, Hodges and Cortes 2006).<br/><br/>In Morocco, <em>M. sylvanus</em> is found in the Rif mountains (northern Morocco) and the Middle and High Atlas Mountains (central Morocco). More specifically, in Morocco the High Atlas populations (two anciently separated populations) are found from Demnat to El Ksba (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013) and around the Ourika Valley. In the Rif, Barbary Macaques are found in the protected areas of Bouhacham Natural Reserve, Talessemtane National Park, and Djebel Moussa (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Algeria, the species is found in the Tellian Atlas (Petite Kabylie and Grande Kabylie Mountains, and an isolated population in the Chréa National Park) in the north. From west to east, Barbary Macaque populations in Algeria are distributed as follows: Park National of Chrea (Gorge Chiffa), Park National of Djurdjura (Djurdjura and Tikjda), Park National of Bejaia, and Gouraya, Forests of Akhfadou, Yakouren, Gorges of Kherrata Forests of Draguina, Forests of Toudja, Park National of Taza (Ait Aloaune, Guerrouch and El Babor) (Benrabah, 2015). Additionally, a Barbary Macaque population might still occur in Djebel Bouzegza (Boumerdes, Grande-Kabylie) (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>The species occurs from sea level to 2,600 m asl (Cuzin 2003).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Macaca sylvanus</em> receives protection under national and international legislation, but law enforcement is inadequate. The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In 2000, the European Community suspended imports of <em>M. sylvanus</em> from Algeria and Morocco under the provisions of Article 4.6b of EC Regulation 338/97 because such trade was deemed to have a harmful impact on the species' status.<br/><br/>In both Morocco and Algeria, the national forestry departments are responsible for the management and the protection of flora and fauna. The Moroccan HCEFCLD collaborates with a Barbary Macaque conservation NGO to confiscate illegally-held macaques. The Moroccan NGO, Barbary Macaque Conservation in the Rif (BMCRif), has had success using social media to raise awareness among the Moroccan public who now regularly report illegally-held macaques in the Rif region, which are then confiscated by the forestry authorities (Waters and El Harrad 2013). The wildlife protection law in Morocco has recently been strengthened and confiscations take place more often. Some individuals are then released into the wild if they meet basic criteria. This strategy is successful for animals under one year of age due to the Barbary Macaque’s allo-parenting behaviour (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>With the rise in human presence and economic development in these regions, there may be an increase of fragmentation and separation, further isolating Barbary Macaques populations and preventing migration/dispersal (Benrabah 2015). However, with careful planning, the highly fragmented populations in Algeria could be reconnected via ecological corridors composed of forest patches, gorges, river basins and scrub regions. Ecological corridors are available for migration/dispersal of animals, provided the necessary actions are undertaken to protect those areas to assure they are suitable for the stable presence of macaques.<br/><br/>There has been some success recorded in Morocco with carefully-planned community projects; although crop raiding by Barbary Macaques does occur, community conservation activities are proving adequate to decrease human-macaque conflict in Bouhachem and persecution of the macaques by shepherds has ceased (Waters 2014).<br/><br/>A number of activities have been undertaken to increase public awareness and reduce illegal trade in this species. The Moroccan NGO BMRif collaborates with both regional and national forestry authorities to raise awareness about the Barbary Macaque including its status as a protected species. AAP (a Netherlands-based sanctuary for exotic animals) has initiated a project to combat illegal trade of Barbary Macaques into Europe, involving inter alia awareness raising among potential buyers, cooperation with authorities in consumer countries and training of customs officers in Spain (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006). The NGO Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation has trained local ecoguards whose task is to prevent attempts to capture macaques in Ifrane National Park for the illegal primate trade.<br/><br/>Most Barbary Macaque habitats in Algeria have national park status. Protected areas in Morocco harbouring populations of this species include the Toubkal National Park, Eastern High Atlas N.P., Ifran N.P., Talassemtane N.P., Bou Hachem Natural Reserve and Djebel Moussa SIBE in Morocco, and the Djurdjura, Taza, Chréa, and Gouraya National Parks in Algeria. However, the parks in Algeria and Morocco suffer from significant human impact, and these areas require much stricter protection than is currently in place.<br/><br/>In Algeria, there is increasing awareness of the importance of protecting Barbary Macaques. For example, managers of the national parks of Chrea, Djurdjura and Gouraya/Bejaia have recently started filling in systematic incident reports any time monkeys are observed being killed, injured or have disappeared as a consequence of human activity (Benrabah 2015). Such records give useful estimates of the type/intensity of threats faced by the monkeys. Although a trend of population decline in Algeria and Morocco has been documented over the last 30 years, the rate of decline has been lower in Algeria than in Morocco. Threats facing Barbary Macaques in Algeria slightly differ from those of the Moroccan population. Tourism impacts are less noticeable in Algeria due to the lack of development of a tourist industry. In addition, surveillance by military and policing authorities is comparably higher in Algeria, contributing to a lower risk of poaching and illegal trade. Habitat degradation and human conflict over agricultural habitats are the primary causes of macaque population decline. Access to mountain and forested regions has increased since the civil strife of the 1990s in Algeria, thus increasing competition between humans and macaques in relation to the use of habitats for agriculture, domestic herd grazing and garbage disposal. <br/><br/>The Moroccan High Commission of Water and Forests along with a Dutch NGO, Moroccan Primate Conservation (MPC), published an action plan for the Barbary Macaque in 2012, focusing on the population in Ifane National Park. In 2016, the Algerian authorities are organising an action planning workshop assisted by IUCN. The Moroccan NGO BMCRif will collaborate with stakeholders to organise action planning workshops in 2017 and 2018 for the Rif populations.</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Mediterranean

One possible explanation for their very large geographic distribution as a genus and as individual species is their ability to use a range of forest types, from várzea to igapó to terra firma (<em>cf</em>, Marsh 2014).<br/><br/>Sakis are the smallest of the pitheciines, but are larger than other non-prehensile-tailed platyrrhines (<em>Aotus</em>, <em>Saimiri</em>, <em>Callicebus </em>and the Callitrichinae). Adults weigh in at 1.5–4.0 kg, with a wide range in total body length (250–980 mm) and tail length (255–545 mm) reflecting the diversity among the taxa. Their tails are often 1:1 with the body length, but in many species tails are longer by &gt;100 mm (based on museum specimen data) for both males and females. Size dimorphism is not striking but, depending on the species, females tend to be lighter in weight and smaller in overall size. Sakis are characterized by their long, coarse, fluffy hair that easily piloerects when they are approached in the wild, making them look bigger than they actually are. The hair on the tail tends to be longer than on the back, but this varies among species, and the tail hair also “puffs up” as a threat. Hair on the trunk is always longer than that on the forearms and hind limbs, and underbellies are very lightly covered or bare. Coronal hairs are directed forward as a hood, and, depending on the species, overlap the facial region making them appear to have “bangs.” Both males and females have distinct throat glands for scent marking, with varying development depending on the species; some males have obvious neck folds and others only a bare skin patch. Sakis are frugivore/ seed predators, but they eat insects such as army ants, as well as spiders, and other arthropods. They vocalize in grunts, chirps, whistles, and low calls, but can be exceptionally quiet when sneaking away from a perceived threat such as a field researcher. Sakis are specialized morphologically for seed predation. The diet is made up of seeds, fruit pulp, young leaves, insects and flowers.&#160;&#160;<br/>Movement Patterns: Locomotion consists of quadrupedal walking/ running, climbing and leaping. Members of this genus form small groups (2-9 individuals) which in some species may resemble a loose “fission-fusion” (Marsh, pers. obs) but core groups generally comprise a single male-female breeding pair and several young. Day ranges (1.5-2 km), home ranges are small (10-25 km) and sakis exhibit behaviours associated with territory defence (<em>cf</em> Marsh 2014).<br/><br/>Congregatory: Somewhat.

They are also sometimes found in the pet trade.,"There is no direct information on the population status of this species throughout its range. However, significant population reduction is suspected based upon ongoing and  significant habitat loss throughout the species' range in Bolivia and  Peru, and particularly due to increasing rates of habitat loss in the Brazilian states  of Rondonia and Mato Grosso, as well as subsistence hunting and live  capture for the pet trade. There is limited information from Bolivia and localized areas in Peru. Overall, it is suspected that there will be a population reduction of at least 30% over three generations (30 years; 2008-2038).",Decreasing,"This species is found in north-western Bolivia, south-eastern Peru and possibly in the south of the state of Rondonia and the west of the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil. <br/><br/><strong>Bolivia</strong> <br/><em>Pithecia rylandsi</em> is found in the western Pando Department but with some evidence that they may be in northeastern Beni and northern La Paz, particularly north/northwest of the Rio Madre de Dios in those areas.

70612310,136366,Sapajus cay,Least Concern,,2018,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern as the species is widespread and there are currently no major threats resulting in a significant overall population decline that would warrant listing it in a threatened category or listing it as NT (Near Threatened). Although population declines were observed over a period of 48 years (three generations), the species is more of a habitat generalist than other species with similar life-histories. However, it is declining in some parts of its range.","The genus is not restricted to primary habitats, but well recognized for its behavioral plasticity (Fragaszy <em>et al.</em> 1990, 2004) and the ability to survive in areas altered by man (Wallace 2008). However, Sapajus may still require relatively large areas of forest for their survival, as in the case of a group of tufted capuchin monitored by Spironelo (1988, 1991) in central Amazonia, which occupied a home range of 1,000 ha.<br/><em>Sapajus cay</em> inhabits subtropical, humid, semi-deciduous, gallery forests and forested regions of the Pantanal, ranging into the Yungas, the dry deciduous forests of northern Bolivian Chaco and eastern Paraguay (not recorded in the Paraguayan Chaco, Stallings 1985, 1989, Wallace 2008). It inhabits Cerrado habitat and riparian and gallery forests in the valleys and hills of the Serra de Maracajú and the Serra de Bodoquena in Mato Grosso do Sul (Pinto 2006, Vieira 2006, Cazzadore 2007, Wallace 2008; Fernandes Júnior 2013).<br/>Yellow-bearded capuchins are extractive and manipulative foragers. They are frugivores-insectivores, including a wide variety of fruits, seeds, arthropods, frogs, nestlings and even small mammals in their diet (Milano and Moteiro Filho 2009), supplemented by stems and flower buds. Males and females disperse, and both sexes are organized in linear dominance hierarchies, the top ranking male being dominant over the top ranking female. Subordinate males and females are often peripheral (Vieira 2006, Pinto 2006, Cazzadore 2007, Fernandes Jr. 2013).<br/><em>Sapajus cay</em> is an adaptable species that also occurs in degraded habitats, for example, one group survived for many decades in a urban area, in Segredo Stream State Park (189 ha) in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil (Pinto 2006, Kazzadore 2007, Rímoli <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/>Movement Patterns: <em>Sapajus cay</em> is a predominantly arboreal, quadrupedal monkey that generally uses home ranges of 150-250 ha and travels &gt;1,000 m per day (Vieira 2006, Fernandes Jr. 2013)&#160;Congregatory: Social groups (Vieira 2006, Pinto 2006, Cazzadore 2007, Rímoli <em>et al.</em> 2009, Fernandes Jr. 2013)","In Paraguay, there are no major threats. It is hunted for subsistence purposes in some parts of its range, but human population density is typically low in these areas. Hunting (by indigenous people) and forest loss are the main threats in eastern Paraguay (Stallings 1985). As in other parts of its range, Sapajus cay is the most commonly kept primate pet in Paraguay.<br/>However, in Brazil, there are severe threats to the survival of the species. The main threats identified for the taxon are: fire, rural settlements, agriculture, livestock keeping, urban sprawl, vulnerability to epidemics, deforestation, increasing road and energy infrastructure, habitat isolation, habitat reduction, pollution, hunting and life capture for pet trade (Rímoli <em>et al.</em> 2015). For example, in Segredo Stream State Park (PEMS) in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, evidence for an inbreeding depression was observed, i.e. polydactyl individuals with six fingers on hands and feet occurred in some small fragments and habitat isolates (Pinto 2006; Cazzadore 2007).","In Brazil, <em>S. cay</em> is distributed in a region that has recently been affected by road and energy infrastructure improvements, urban sprawl, rural settlements, agriculture, livestock farming and deforestation. It is estimated that these threats have caused severe habitat loss and population fragmentation (see Habitat and Ecology for further comments). Based on information obtained from reporting forms on the genus <em>Sapajus</em> in the Amazon, that can be used for habitat areas of more than 1,000 ha (Spironelo 1988, 1991), it is suspected that the population has experienced at least a 30% decrease over the last three generations or 48 years.<br/><br/>The overall extent of occurrence is estimated at 123,615.35 km². However, the remaining total population size is not known and it remains unclear whether the number of mature individuals is greater than 10,000 individuals (Rímoli<em> et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Stallings (1985) recorded a mean group size of seven individuals (N=4 groups) in the Ybicui National Park. However, larger groups averaging 22 (Vieira 2006) or 25 individuals (Fernandes Jr. 2013) were also recorded.<br/>Population density in the Ybicui National Park was estimated as 4 groups/km² or 28 individuals/km² (Stallings 1985). At other sites population densities were estimated as 0.31 individuals/ha in the upper Rio Paraná region, MS (Aguiar<em> et al.</em> 2011), 0.15 individuals/ha in Terenos, MS (Vieira 2006), and 0.19 individuals/ha in Campo Grande, MS (Pinto 2006, Cazzadore 2007).",Decreasing,"In Brazil, <em>Sapajus cay</em> occurs in the state of Mato Grosso, in south (Cabrera 1957; Wallace 2008), east, west and south-west of Mato Grosso do Sul (Pinto 2006; Vieira 2006; Cazzadore 2007; Rímoli <em>et al.</em> 2009; Fernandes Jr. 2013) and in Goiás State (Melo F.R. unpubl. data), where it is resident and native. It can also reach the regions of Cassilândia (MS) and Itajá (GO) (Melo F.R. unpubl. data) and the Comodoro region (MT) which represents the most western part of its distribution (Messias M. pers. comm.). The northern limit of the species’ range is the southern part of the Xingu Indigenous Park (Garapu Desk, Sete de Setembro River and Lake Ipavu) in Mato Grosso (Silva Jr. 2001). The eastern boundary seems to be the Araguaia River, while the southeastern limit is the Paraná River (Silva Jr. 2001) where it occurs on the islands and floodplains of the Paraná River in an Environmental Protection Area (Aguiar <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>This species is not endemic to Brazil, also occurring in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay (Cabrera 1957; Wallace 2008). It occurs throughout Paraguay, to south-east Bolivia, and into northern Argentina, including the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Formosa and Chaco (Mantecon <em>et al.</em> 1984; Brown 1989).<br/><br/>In Paraguay, <em>S. cay</em> occurs to the east of the Paraguay River (Hill 1960; Stallings 1985, 1989). The distribution extends southward to the eastern part of Paraguay (Stallings 1985; Brown and Colillas 1984), reaching into northwestern Argentina. Capuchin monkeys are not found in the Chaco region of the Provinces of Formosa and Chaco in northern Argentina. Thus, the distribution of <em>S. cay</em> forms a horseshoe shape, bordering the xerophytic Chaco of Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay (Brown and Rumiz 1986).

This species is capable of using tools whilst foraging (e.g. Fragaszy <em>et al.</em> 2004, Visalberghi <em>et al.</em> 2008), which is an uncommon behaviour among Neotropical primates. It is highly resistant to anthropogenic disturbances and can survive in areas of disturbed habitat. A home range size of 135 ha was observed in Serra da Capivara (Moura 2007).","<em>Sapajus libidinosus</em> lives in the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil. The ongoing habitat loss was estimated at 50% for the Cerrado until 2002 (Machado<em> et al.</em> 2002) and at 50% for the Caatinga until 2009 (IBGE 2012). This species is severely hunted and collected from the wild for the illegal pet trade. The seriousness of the hunting pressure is demonstrated by the high number of individuals seized from illegal trade by the Wild Animal Screening Centers (CETAS-IBAMA, Levacov <em>et al.</em> 2011). Most of these seized individuals cannot return to the wild because of physical and behavioral disorders caused in captivity. Additional threats are hybrids or exotics deliberately released from captivity. Most populations in the Caatinga biome are isolated on hills and mountains, often damaging or feeding on crops of nearby farms, causing conflicts with farmers and often leading to persecution.","Ferreira <em>et al.</em> (2009) observed a group of 53 individuals, but considering the great variation in group size among capuchins, further studies are necessary. In addition, some studies reported population densities as follows: three groups/km² and 6.7 groups/km² in the Parque Estadual Altamiro de Moura Pacheco, Goiânia, GO (Villar<em> et al.</em> 2007), and 7.1 to 11.3 individuals/km² in the Serra da Capivara (Moura 2007).<br/>The population is declining due to ongoing habitat loss. Both Caatinga and Cerrado biomes, the regions in which the species occurs, have almost lost 50% of suitable habitat due to continued deforestation (Machado <em>et al</em>. 2002, IBGE 2012).",Decreasing,"The species occurs in northeastern Brazil, in the eastern part of the state of Maranhão, from the basin of the Mearim and Itapecuru Rivers, through Piaui and Ceará Staes, into Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco, and Alagoas States. It ranges west of the Rio São Francisco, through the Cerrado or bush savanna, into Tocantins, Goiás, western Minas Gerais (Silva Jr. 2001) and São Paulo States (above the Tietê River; Aquinho<em> et al. </em>2010). It further occurs in parts of western Bahia and northeastern Mato Grosso, being replaced by <em>S. apella</em> to the north in transition to the Amazon rain forest and the dry forests of Mato Grosso (Silva Jr. 2001). Silva Jr. (2001) indicates that the right (east) bank of the Rio Araguaia may be the westernmost limit to its range to the north, with <em>S. apella </em>occurring west of the left bank, and further south, at the headwaters, giving way to <em>S. cay.</em> The southern limit is in the region of the Rio Grande in western Minas Gerais (Triângulo Mineiro) and northwestern São Paulo. <em>Sapajus nigritus</em> occurs to the south of the Rio Grande (Fragaszy <em>et al.</em> 2004; Rylands<em> et al.</em> 2005).",,Terrestrial,"This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.

Major threat factors are related to loss, fragmentation and disconnection of the habitat, urban expansion, increase in roads and energy matrix, hunting and hybridization. It is suspected that these factors are leading to a population reduction of about 30% within three generations (48 years). For these reasons the taxon was classified as Near Threatened (NT) approaching the A4cde criteria.","<em>Sapajus nigritus </em>inhabits lowland, sub-montane and montane tropical and subtropical forest of the Atlantic coast of Brazil and also in gallery forest. The taxon is tolerant to environmental changes and disturbances, occurring in secondary forests and utilizing pine and eucalyptus plantations and also inhabits fragments close to corn, bananas and cassava fields (Ludwig <em>et al.</em> 2006) and sugar-cane fields (Rímoli 2001, Rímoli<em> et al</em>. 2008).Capuchins are insectivore-frugivores, including a wide range of plant species, a variety of fruits, seeds and arthropods, frogs, nestlings and even small mammals in their diet, supplemented by stems, flowers and leaves (Ludwig <em>et al. </em>2005, Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2013). They are extractive manipulative foragers and can use tools to access larvae and nuts (Izawa 1979, Fernandes 1991, Rocha <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160;The home range recorded for 3 groups in the Iguazú National Park, Argentina was 161±77 ha (range 81-293 ha) (Di Bitetti, 2001); for one group in Paraná, Ludwig <em>et al</em>. 2005 estimated a 56 ha home range; in São Paulo home ranges of 117 ha (Izar <em>et al.</em> 2007), 5 ha and 10 ha (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2005) and 465.3 ha (Izar and Sato 1999) were estimated; and in Minas Gerais, Rímoli 2001 estimated 268 ha.Group sizes range from 11 to 23 (Aguiar 2006, Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2005), although Lynch &amp; Rímoli (2000) noted a maximum group size of about 30 animals at Caratinga Biological Station, Brazil. The number of females exceeds the number of males. Males disperse from their natal groups, but females are usually philopatric; females may also transfer groups especially when groups divide or there is a change of the alpha male (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2013). The top ranking male is dominant to the top-ranking female. However, the ranks of the lower ranking individuals are not always easy to determine (Lynch 2001, Izar 2006). Subordinate males may be peripheral (Freese &amp; Oppenheimer 1981, Fragaszy <em>et al</em>. 2004), but also may form close bonds with other group members (Lynch 2001).<br/><br/>Movement Patterns: Terrestrial (range behavior with day range movement ranging from 750 m in Dry Season to 3000 m in Wet Season, in a forest fragment in Atlantic Forest (Rímoli 2001).Congregatory: Social groups. Group sizes range from 11 to 23 (Aguiar 2006, Silveira <em>et al</em>. 2005) to 24-29 individuals (Lynch and Rímoli 2000, Rímoli 2001, Lynch 2001)","Although quite wide ranging, the species is nonetheless subject to habitat reduction, loss and degradation, besides fire, rural settlements, increasing road and agriculture matrix, predation by exotic species, hunting and gathering across its range. Another threat is hybridization with congeneric species (Lynch Alfaro <em>et al.</em> 2014). The species is considered a crop pest in some areas (in sugar cane and pine plantations). Otherwise, it is generally scarce except in the larger protected areas.","Total remaining population is not known and it is unclear whether the number of mature individuals of this taxon is greater than 10,000.<br/><br/>Di Bitetti (2001) recorded a population density of 16 individuals/km² in the Iguazu National Park, Argentina.

There are no known significant threats that could lead the species to the risk of extinction. In addition, it exhibits some tolerance to environmental disturbances and a good portion of its distribution is in protected areas.","An inhabitant of Amazonian lowland rain forest.<br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps and latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging tree trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, in some species gum forms a notable component of the diet (Coimbra-Filho &amp; Mittermeier 1976 and Rylands 1984).

The deforested area where the species arrived in 2012 was 3,132km² (ProDes 2014). However, the percentage of habitat loss inside Protected Areas and Indigenous land was low (0.1%). Barber <em>et al.</em> (2012) argue that the most basic measure of the effectiveness of a protected area is how well its forest cover has been and continues to be preserved. Protected Areas and Indigenous Land are effective to assure a low index of deforestation, to face the different pressures identified for that region. Although currently not threatened, a number of plausible future threats and how they would influence this species are highlighted below:<br/>1. Environmental crime - Land grab and Selective logging by illegal wood companies are two criminal activities reported by local authorities. The land grabbers have illegal documents of land ownership. The illegal logging companies operate in the selective logging of tree species for commercial interest. After that, the land is occupied for clear cutting and implementation of pastures (Loureiro &amp; Pinto 2005).<br/>2. Expansion of cattle ranching - According to IBGE (2014) Novo Aripuanã and Apuí, the two main cities where<em> Mico chrysoleucus</em> occurs, sum of 160,100 herds, are classified between the top five cities where cattle ranching is increasing continually.<br/>3. Improvement of the road system - The road AM 174 connects the Apuí and Novo Aripuanã cities throughout the <em>M. chrysoleucus</em> distribution. This road represents a pressure of new deforestation focus in a fishbone system, if no effective measure can be implemented to conciliate the Infrastructure improvement and Biodiversity Conservation.<br/>4. Hydroelectric Schemes - In 2012, the National Agency of Electrical Energy (ANEEL) approved the assessment of the hydroelectric potential of the Aripuanã and Roosevelt River basin, aiming the implementation of seven hydroelectric schemes (ANEEL 2012).&#160; Two of these hydroelectric schemes will be implemented within the species’ geographical range, one in the “Prainha” area (Aripuanã River - 7º13’41’’S, 60º39’08’’W) and the other in the “Samaúma” area (7º54’44’’S, 60º11’48’’W). The reservoirs of “Prainha” and “Samaúma” will directly affect the area of occurrence of <em>M. chrysoleucus</em> as well as <em>Mico marcai</em> and <em>Callibella humilis</em>, the marmosets found in the left bank of Aripuanã River.

Along the Rio Juruá, and undoubtedly elsewhere in its range, it tends to be more common in seasonally flooded forest (<em>várzea</em>) than in <em>terra firma</em> forest (Peres 1997; Queiroz 1995).<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are the large leaf-eaters of the South American primate communities. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. They spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting about quietly among the branches, fermenting leaves in their enlarged caecums. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaws which surround the enlarged larynx and hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber. It is with this enlarged and highly specialized voice box that they produce their howls (grunts, roars and barks). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 kms (Drubbel and Gautier 1993).<br/><br/>Fourteen is a large group for the red howler monkeys; they usually number four or five or up to 11 or so individuals.  In the red howlers, there is usually only one dominant male in the group (occasionally two), others being sub-adults, or juveniles, along with a harem of two to five females. Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), the howler monkeys generally have quite small and broadly overlapping home ranges, of 5 ha up to 45 ha, depending on the type of habitat (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988).<br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria. <br/><br/>Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days. Interbirth intervals are generally about 16.6 months, although they may be shortened by the death of an infant to about 10.5 months (Crockett and Sekulic 1984). Mean gestation length is 191 days (range 186-194, n=6) (as for <em>A. seniculus seniculus</em> in Crockett and Sekulic [1982], considered here to be <em>A. arctoidea</em>).<br/><br/>Size: <br/>As for <em>Alouatta seniculus seniculus</em>, Brazil<br/>Adult male 7.62 kg (n=28) (Ayres 1986)<br/>Adult female 6.02 kg (n=34) (Ayres 1986).","There are probably no major threats across the range, although Aquino and Encarnación (1994a) reported that populations of red howlers have declined in the lower parts of the <em>selva alta</em> (high forest) in the Peruvian Amazon as a result of colonization by humans, hunting and deforestation, noting particularly the valley of Chanchamayo (Department of Junín) where they have been extirpated.

They can have as many as 14 or 15 individuals, but they usually number four or five or up to 11 or so individuals.  Group sizes recorded by Mendes Pontes (1999) on the Island of Maracá, Roraima, were generally small (from 1-5). Soini (192) observed group sizes ranging from 3-8 (mean 5.54±1.59, n=74) in the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, Peru. Adult males will often be solitary. In red howlers, there is usually only one dominant male in the group (occasionally two), others being sub-adults, or juveniles, along with a harem of two to five females.

Gaulin and Gaulin (1982) recorded a home range of 22 ha for a group of nine howlers in cloud forest at 2,300 m. In the llanos of northern Venezuela, home ranges of <em>A. arctoidea</em> can be as small as 4 ha (Sekulic 1982).

The reason for this and the consumption of soil from termitaria is still not clearly understood, but may involve the need for certain minerals, or may be due to the properties of clay which, by adsorption, can reduce the effects of toxins ingested with leaves.<br/><br/>Infant <em>Alouatta</em> are probably born throughout the year in Suriname, but data are not yet sufficient to determine if there is a birth peak. Crockett and Rudran (1987a,b) examined seasonal variation in births in red howlers from northern Venezuela, and found that they were less frequent during the early wet season (weaning would occur at the time of greatest food shortage). The llanos forests are more seasonal, however, than in the Guianas, and it is possible that this is not the case elsewhere. Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days. Interbirth intervals are generally about 16.6 months, although they may be shortened by the death of an infant to about 10.5 months (Crockett and Sekulic 1984).

81229559,136787,Alouatta puruensis,Least Concern,,2015,2008-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,This subspecies is listed as Least Concern given its widespread distribution and lack of apparent major threats believed to be resulting in a significant decline that would warrant listing the taxon in Near Threatened or a threatened category. Further survey work is needed to clarify the distribution limits of the taxon relative to <em>A. sara</em> in Bolivia.,"This subspecies is found in lowland, evergreen rain forest. Along the Rio Juruá, and undoubtedly elsewhere in its range, it tends to be more common in seasonally flooded forest (<strong>várzea</strong>) than in <em>terra firma</em> forest (Peres 1997).<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are the large leaf-eaters of the South American primate communities. The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. They spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting about quietly among the branches, fermenting leaves in their enlarged caecums. Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaw which surround the enlarged larynx and hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber. It is with this enlarged and highly specialized voice box that they produce their howls (grunts, roars and barks). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 kms (Drubbel and Gautier 1993).<br/><br/>Red howler groups are usually small, ranging in size from 2-16 animals and averaging 4-10 (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988). There is usually only one dominant male in the group (occasionally two), others being sub-adults, or juveniles, along with a harem of two to five females. Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), the howler monkeys generally have quite small and broadly overlapping home ranges, of 5 ha up to 45 ha, depending on the type of habitat (Neville <em>et al</em>. 1988). The large groups of <em>A. palliata</em> may have home ranges extending to 60 ha (Estrada 1982), whereas in the llanos of northern Venezuela, home ranges of <em>A. arctoidea</em> can be as small as 4 ha (Sekulic 1982a).  <br/><br/>Howlers are the only New World primates which regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems and twigs, and termitaria.<br/><br/>Oestrus lasts 2-4 days, with intervals between oestrous periods of about 17 days. Interbirth intervals are generally about 16.6 months, although they may be shortened by the death of an infant to about 10.5 months (Crockett and Sekulic 1984). Mean gestation length is 191 days (range 186-194, n=6) (as for <em>A. seniculus seniculus</em> in Crockett and Sekulic 1982)<br/><br/>Size: <br/>As for <em>Alouatta seniculus</em>, Brazil<br/>Adult male 7.62 kg (n=28) (Ayres 1986)<br/>Adult female 6.02 kg (n=34) (Ayres 1986).","No major threats across the range, although habitat loss and hunting are no doubt taking place. Aquino and Encarnación (1994a) reported that populations of red howlers have declined in the lower parts of the selva alta in the Peruvian Amazon as a result of colonization by humans, hunting and deforestation, noting particularly the valley of Chanchamayo (Department of Junín) where they have been extirpated.","Peres (1997) estimated population densities of howler monkeys at a number of sites on the right (east) bank of the Rio Juruá (presumably <em>A. seniculus puruensis</em>): Vai Quem Quer (<em>terra firma</em> forest), 1.0 individuals/km²; Igarapé Jaraquí (<em>terra firma</em> forest), 5.5 individuals/km²; Penedo (<em>terra firma</em> forest), 2.6 individuals/km²; Boa Esperança (<em>várzea</em>), 89.7 individuals/km². Peres (1997) found that populations were higher in <em>várzea</em> (seasonally inundated) forests than in <em>terra firma</em> forests.",Unknown,"This red howler monkey extends west from the lower Rio Madeira (left bank) and the Rio Aripuanã across the basin of the Rio Purus to the Rios Juruá and Envira, as postulated by Gregorin (2006). It occurs in northern Rondônia, but the southern limits to its range in Brazil are unclear. It is not clear whether it is the form in north-west Bolivia and far south-eastern Peru in the basins of the upper Purus, Madre de Dios and Tampopata. According to Anderson (1997), only <em>Alouatta sara</em> occurs in Bolivia. Aquino and Encarnacion (1994a) did not consider subspecies or any species other than <em>A. seniculus</em>. Red howlers occur throughout the Peruvian Amazon from the Río Inamabari in the far south-east, along the Rio Urubamba, through the Pachitea to the right (east) bank of the Rio Huallaga, north accompanying the Cordillera to cross the Río Marañón, extending into Ecuador along the Río Santiago (left bank).

The species is inferred to have experienced a population size decline of at least 80% over the last 24 years (three generations; Nadler&#160;<em>et al. </em>2007) due to severe and persistent and ongoing persecution for the pet trade (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010), in combination with habitat loss.","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This species is nocturnal and arboreal, and is found in secondary disturbed forest, in plantations and to some extent in primary forests.

Together with other loris species,&#160;<em>N. javanicus</em>&#160;is one of&#160;the most common protected primates found in animal markets in Java (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Thorn&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). Due to their non-leaping locomotion, their choice of sleeping sites in trees and bamboo that can be cut through and accessed, and nocturnal habits, the animals are easily caught by humans (Nekaris and Starr 2015). The majority of the trade is to satisfy a large domestic demand, with a smaller proportion being smuggled abroad to destinations like the Middle East and Japan (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2015). From there the species may appear on online videos which perpetuate the pet trade (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013). The trade chain poses a perilous threat for many reasons. Conditions during transport (stuffed in boxes or sacks) and inappropriate husbandry techniques (poor diet and social housing, forced diurnal activity, excessive handling) afterwards result in large mortality rate. Slow Lorises are the only venomous primates; to avoid their bites middle men or traders cut or remove teeth, a process that almost invariably leads to the animal’s death (Nekaris and Starr 2015). If confiscated, reintroduction to the wild has proven difficult. Animals with no teeth are not viable candidates, and in a two-year study of 11 healthy radio-collared animals released, only two are known to have survived (Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).<span class=""apple-converted-space"">  </span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Hybridization poses a real threat both on Java and elsewhere.

Due to the morphological similarity of&#160;<em>Nycticebus</em>&#160;spp. misidentification is rife. Furthermore, there is a general feeling that ‘if it is a slow loris, release it.’ Not only does this pose welfare risks to the individual, but also translocated individuals may harbour infections and parasites, and could potentially hybridize (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Schulze and Groves 2004).</span></p>","<span class=""apple-converted-space"">This species has been recorded at very low densities (0.02-0.20/km) (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008).

In Ghana, many forests have been converted to rubber plantations. In Côte d’Ivoire, in the last decade, several forest reserves and protected areas that the species formerly inhabited have been completely converted into plantations, resulting in&#160;the local extirpation of the species and other primates in these forests (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015).

According to FAO 2015 data, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and Sierra Leone lost a combined 6% of their forest-woodland area over 25 years (1990–2015). The species is locally hunted for meat, and this is an increasingly important threat with ongoing forest fragmentation, because animals can be located more easily by hunters in small forest fragments. <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Increasing hunting pressure and bushmeat traffic is affecting the species in Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (Kümpel <em>et al</em>. 2008, <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Covey and McGraw 2014, <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Greengrass 2016, <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015<span class=""apple-converted-space"">). <em>Cercocebus atys</em> is the most hunted primate species in the <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Forécariah/Kounounkan region of coastal Guinea bordering Sierra Leone (Dufour 2013), and the species is among the most hunted primates in the Sime Darby oil palm concession in central Liberia (Béné <em>et al</em>. 2013b,c). A survey in Liberia's Nimba County revealed that Sooty Mangabeys were the most common primate in bushmeat markets, representing 3.03% of all market prey (Bene <em>et al.</em> 2013b,c).<br/><br/>Sooty Mangabeys are natural reservoir hosts of&#160;Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). Despite a high prevalence in the wild population, the virus has no detectable impact on the survival or health of this host species (Silvestri <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160;Sooty Mangabeys do not develop AIDS despite high levels of SIV infection because of several genetically-based mechanisms that enhance immune function (Palesch <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;<em>Cercocebus atys</em> can contract leprosy (Rojas-Espinosa and Løvik 2001), and Type 2 diabetes is more common in mangabeys than in other primate species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The bushmeat trade, the practice of keeping monkeys as pets, and the growing number of people living near wild Sooty Mangabeys significantly increases the risk of transmission of multiple zoonotic diseases (Mossoun <em>et al</em>. 2015)</span></span></span></p>","<p>  </p><p>Current, comprehensive data on the abundance and distribution of Sooty Mangabeys throughout much of their six-country range are lacking; however, available evidence suggests the species has declined across most of its distribution.

Recent surveys failed to detect the species in the Dodo Coastal Forest of southwestern Côte d’Ivoire (Soiret <em>et al</em>. 2019) and the Tonkpi region of west-central Côte d’Ivoire (Kramoko&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>During nationwide surveys of Liberia, Sooty Mangabeys were the second most common monkey detected on line transects (Junker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys of four counties (Gbarpolu, Bomi, Bong and Grand Cape Mount) comprising the Sime Darby Plantation (oil palm, rubber) reported Sooty mangabeys present, although specific locality information were not published (Béné <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Several surveys carried out over the last ten years in the Mount Nimba region confirm the presence of Sooty Mangabeys there (Béné <em>et al</em>. 2013b,c, Granier 2016). In southeastern Liberia, surveys in the Grebo-Sapo Corridor reported a Sooty Mangabey encounter rate (groups/km) of 0.08 (Furnell <em>et al</em>. 2015a). The species appears to still be common in Sapo National Park (Vogt, 2011, Oates 2011) though it is hunted regularly (Greengrass 2016). Encounter rates in the Putu Range (0.09) are significantly lower than those inside Sapo National Park (0.19) (Vogt, 2011). During a 4-month survey in 2015, Sooty Mangabeys were heard but not seen in the newly-created Grebo-Krahn National Park (Furnell <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015b).<br/><br/>In Guinea in 1992, the species was often encountered during a 10-day field visit to the Kounounkan region, near the small town of Moussayah, Forécariah Province (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 1994). However, it was rarely encountered during a rapid assessment of the primate fauna conducted in 2005 in Sangaredi sub-prefecture in northwestern Boké Préfecture (Eriksson and Kpoghomou 2006). During site visits in 2017 and 2018, Sooty Mangabeys were observed in several areas in the Fouta Djallon region (R.A. Mittermeier pers. comm. 2017, C. André pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Recent surveys confirm Sooty Mangabeys near the village of Beli in the Boe region of Guinea-Bissau (Binczik <em>et al</em>. 2017) and they are present in Cantanhez Forest National Park (Garriga <em>et al</em>. 2018); however, their presence elsewhere in Guinea-Bissau is no longer certain (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003, Minhos <em>et al</em>.

It is not possible, however, to translate such encounter rates accurately into population density estimates, especially in the case of a species like <em>C. atys</em> whose calls carry for a considerable distance in the forest, and whose calling patterns can be affected by many factors. A nationwide survey of chimpanzees in Sierra Leone revealed Sooty Mangabeys mostly in the northern part of the country where human population numbers are lower (Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015).

Associated with this increase in human population and the spread of settlement, agriculture, timber harvesting and development projects, forest cover in these same nine countries is estimated by FAO (2015) to have fallen from 671,880 km² in 1990 to 530,900 km² in 2015—a forest loss of 21%. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are among three of 10 countries in the world that had the fastest annual acceleration of tree cover loss in the 2001–2014 period, based on an analysis of satellite imagery, with Sierra Leone recording the world’s second greatest annual forest loss rate of 12.6% (Petersen <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><em>Perodicticus potto </em>is also hunted, mainly for subsistence, but the species occurs in the commercial trade as well. It has been observed in the bushmeat trade (Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and Nigeria), in the pet trade (Nigeria, Liberia and Togo) and in the trade for traditional medicines and practices (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana) (Svensson and Friant 2014, Svensson <em>et al</em>. 2015, Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the forest zone of West Africa, smaller mammals began to feature more commonly in the bushmeat trade more than a decade ago, as larger-bodied wild mammals have become scarce (Swensson 2005). This trend is now impacting on species such as <em>P. potto</em>, whose decline is suggested by a recent reduction in the number of pottos seen in western Nigeria in the possession of hunters or in bushmeat markets (R.

Over much of its range, it is associated with fire-climax Miombo (<em>Brachystegia</em>) woodland. Both in this zone and especially to the northeast of its range, the species may also occupy dry bushland, thickets, steppes, and the coastal littoral (including mangroves). Fever Trees (<em>Acacia xanthophloea</em>) and Tortilis Trees (<em>A. tortilis</em>) are often used as both sources of food and shelter (Altmann <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Yellow Baboon typically forages in extended, well-spaced troops that may occasionally number up to 300 animals, though more typically average 30 to 80 individuals. The species is not territorial but, instead, uses home ranges that may overlap with other troops’ ranges. They drink almost daily, so their ranges tend to include a water source within a half-day’s journey (Altmann <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Like other members of the genus, Yellow Baboons are opportunistic omnivores. They primarily feed on the seeds, flesh, and pods of the leguminous trees including <em>Acacia</em>, <em>Albizia</em>, mopane (<em>Colophospermum</em>), and tamarind, all of which are seasonal staples. They also feed on grasses, shoots, fungi, lichens, and a range of animal prey, including invertebrates, lizards, birds, reptile and bird eggs, and small mammals. The latter include other primates, such as Vervet Monkeys (<em>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</em>) and Northern Lesser Galago (<em>Galago senegalensis</em>) (Altmann <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  <p>Yellow Baboons prefer foods with unusual chemistry, suggesting that this species has acquired special digestive adaptations. Such adaptations may help to explain why the boundaries of the species’ distribution do not follow specific geographic discontinuities but coincide closely with the distribution of a plant community (Jolly 1993, Kingdon 1997). </p>  <p>Although Yellow Baboons exhibit clear preference for woodland life, they can persist in secondary and highly fragmented vegetation, including areas that have been cultivated. In fact, some troops have adapted to living close to humans and regularly visit garbage dumps for foraging. While wild-foraging groups may spend approximately 70–75% of their time foraging and travelling up to 10 km per day, baboon troops that exploit garbage dumps forage for only 35–40% and travel only 2–4 km per day (Muruthi <em>et al.</em> 1991).</p>  <p>Extensive review and summary of the Yellow Baboon’s anatomy, behaviour and reproduction may be found in Altmann <em>et al</em>.

Studies using niche modelling found that the environments Kinda Baboons inhabit are distinct compared with other baboon species (Fuchs <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>There have been no systematic studies of their diet content, but Kinda Baboons are omnivorous, with a preference for fruits. Similar to other baboons, Kinda Baboons spend about 35% of their time feeding, 14% travelling, 32% resting, and 19% in social activities (Weyher, unpublished data). Higher temperatures are associated with more time spent feeding and travelling and less time in social activity and resting, while higher humidity is associated with more time spent feeding and in social activity (Weyher, unpublished data). These findings suggest a vulnerability to climate change.<br/><br/>As with the Yellow, Chacma, and Olive Baboons, females form a close social bond; most adult grooming partnerships occur between females. However, male-female relationships and female-female relationships of Kinda Baboons differ substantially from those seen in Yellow, Chacma, and Olive Baboons, suggesting that the social system of the Kinda Baboon constitutes a further variant of baboon social systems (Weyher <em>et al</em>. 2014). Compared with other baboons, the Kinda Baboon exhibits relatively low degrees of sexual dimorphism and large relative testis size, leading to the suggestion that they have evolved under reduced direct, and increased indirect, male-male competition (Petersdorf <em>et al. </em>2019).</p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk30946988"">There are no major threats to this species across its range, though some populations may be under pressure from agriculture and development projects.

A rapid population reduction has been observed. One, probably two, of the three historic (pre-2009) populations are now extinct. The geographic distribution of the one confirmed remaining populations (currently in an area of approximately 11,500 km² in the western Serengeti) appears to be about 56% the size that it was in 1995 (20,536 km²) and now comprises two fragments. The current number of <em>E. baumstarki</em> is probably between 80 and 200 individuals; the number of mature individuals may now be no more than 40 to 100 individuals. The EOO, area of occupancy (AOO), and population size are expected to continue to decline as the causes (mainly habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss, but also hunting and reduced access to water) are ongoing and unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future. </p>","<em>Erythrocebus baumstarki</em> is a medium-sized, diurnal, largely terrestrial, monkey. Occurs mainly in semi-arid acacia woodland, particularly Whistling Thorn Acacia (<em>Acacia drepanolobium</em>) woodland (De Jong <em>et al.</em> 2009). The habits and ecology of this species are poorly known but are likely similar to those of <em>E. p. pyrrhonotus</em> in northwestern Uganda (Hall 1965) and central Kenya (Chism and Rowell 1988, Isbell 1998, 2013).","<p>The main threats to <em>E. baumstarki </em>are habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss due primarily to agricultural expansion and intensification (both crops and livestock), charcoal production, fire, and ‘development’ activities (<em>e.g.,</em> settlements, roads; De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2009, Loishooki <em>et al.</em> 2016), but also hunting and loss of access to water. In Grumeti Game Reserve, western Serengeti, Whistling Thorn Acacia woodlands are disappearing due to over-stocking by livestock (G. Tolchard pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Bushmeat is a serious problem in the western Serengeti (K. Snyder pers. comm. 2020) and a threat to <em>E. baumstarki</em> (Loishooki <em>et al.</em> 2016). The pelt is used in traditional ceremonies (including dances and witchcraft). Hunted in retaliation for crop raiding (Loishooki <em>et al.</em> 2016). Hunted by domestic dogs in Burko Masailand Hunting Concession (D. Hurt pers. comm. 2019) and, probably, other places.<br/><br/>The human population is doubling every 20-30 years over much of the range of <em>E. baumstarki. </em>‘Rate of Natural Increase’ of the human population in Tanzania is 3.0%, compared to a worldwide rate of 1.1% (PRB 2019). Over the past decade, the western boundary of the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem experienced a sharp human population increase, including a four-fold increase in some of the higher rainfall areas (Veldhuis <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>The human population growth rate is also high in the Arusha-Kilimanjaro region (TNBS &#160;2020). Patas habitat is being increasingly converted into cropland in the densely settled areas at the western boundary of the protected areas of the western Serengeti (Serengeti National Park, Maswa Game Reserve, Keijereshi Game Reserve, Grumeti Game Reserve, Ikorongo Game Reserve, Ikona Wildlife Management Area). Due to a shortage of grazing land, pastoralists move their livestock illegally into protected areas (Veldhuis <em>et al</em>. 2019). As such, there is ever increasing competition between people and <em>E. baumstarki</em> for habitat and water (De Jong <em>et al.</em> 2009, G. Tolchard pers. comm. 2019). Within the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the human populations increased nine-fold in just 46 years (from 8,700 in 1966 to 79,000 in 2012) while the number of livestock in 2012 was 300,000 (IUCN 2014).</p>","<p>Old records indicate that <em>Erythrocebus baumstarki</em> has, historically, always occurred at low densities.<br/><br/>Numbers of <em>E. baumstarki</em> are in rapid decline. In 2009, there were &lt;900 individuals in Tanzania (De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2009). Currently, it can be assumed that the remaining global population (now limited to Tanzania) has between 80 and 200 <em>E. baumstarki </em>remaining in the wild.<em> </em>Given that about half of the individuals in populations of <em>E. patas</em> are mature (Hall 1965, Struhsaker and Gartlan 1970, Chism and Rowell 1988), the number of mature <em>E. baumstarki</em> is probably between 40 and 100.<br/><br/>One, probably two, of the three historic (pre-2009) populations are now extinct (of those that existed before 1995). The Serengeti population appears to be in rapid decline. Twenty-one encounters with <em>Erythrocebus</em> in Tanzania have been documented since January 2009. Nineteen of these records are from the western Serengeti (1-24 individuals/encounter), one from Ngorongoro Conservation Area (one individual, 2012), and one from the Arusha population (one individual, 2014). Some western Serengeti groups were likely counted more than once. Ten of the western Serengeti records were obtained during a survey completed in 2015 (Loishooki <em>et al</em>. 2016). Ten of the 21 records are for solitary individuals and 11 records are for groups. Group size for five of the 11 groups is unknown, six groups comprised 2-24 individuals (83 individuals in total; mean = 12.2 individuals/group). Assuming that all six groups were encountered only once, the total number of individuals in Tanzania between January 2009 and December 2019 was between 93 (83 individuals and five uncounted groups with a minimum of two individuals) and 203 (83 individuals and five uncounted groups with a maximum of 24 individuals. It is highly likely, however, that some solitary individuals and groups were encountered more than once, particularly as the distance between some encounters was small (&lt;100 m). It may be that there are groups in Tanzania that have remained undetected. </p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Erythocebus baumstarki</em> is e<a name=""_Hlk28858984"">ndemic to central north Tanzania. In March 2006, T. Butynski and Y. de Jong identified an <em>E. baumstarki</em> skin, from an unknown location in Kenya (specimen ZD.1934.4.7.1, labelled as “<em>Erythocebus patas”</em>), in the Natural History Museum (London). This specimen was collected by Lord Rothschild sometime prior to 1935, presumably in southern Kenya. Patas are known in southern Kenya from the </a>Masai Mara-Loita Hills region and from the Namanga-Amboseli-Tsavo West-Athi River region (De Jong <em>et al.</em> 2008). Although these sites are contiguous with sites for <em>E. baumstarki</em> in northern Tanzania (De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2009), and the Patas of southern Kenya can be safely presumed to be <em>baumstarki</em>, we are not aware of any photographs or specimens of Patas from southern Kenya. Thus, specimen ZD.1934.4.7.1 appears to be the only confirmation that the population of Patas in south Kenya is/was a population of <em>baumstarki.</em><br/><br/>During a primate survey in the Loita Hills (southern Kenya) in 2012, unverified verbal reports of at least one group of <em>E. patas </em>were received from local people. Otherwise, there are no post-2004 records for Patas from southern Kenya (F. Allan, T. Allan, Z. Cockar, S. Dloniak, D. Grammaticas, S. Hatfield, B. Heath, J. Heath, P. Reynolds, H.

Mutiso pers. comm. 2008). Given the 14-year absence of records for Patas from southern Kenya, it appears that <em>E. baumstarki</em> has been </a>extirpated from Kenya.<br/><br/>With the extirpation of <em>E.</em> <em>baumstarki</em> from Kenya, this species is now endemic to central north Tanzania. Here it occurred in three populations as of 1995: Serengeti ecosystem (including western Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Grumeti Game Reserve), southwest of Mount Kilimanjaro, and southwest of Arusha (De Jong <em>et al.</em> 2009) with a total geographic distribution of <em>ca </em>37,400 km² (De Jong <em>et al</em>. 2009, R. Knocker pers. comm. 2012, Y. de Jong &amp; T. Butynski unpubl. data 2019). Today, the Kilimanjaro population probably no longer exist (C. Foley pers. comm. 2019). The most recent evidence for the Arusha population is from 2014 when a Patas was killed by a domestic dog in Burko Masailand Hunting Concession (D. Hurt pers. comm.). Preliminary data suggest that the historic geographic distribution of the Serengeti population (<em>ca</em>. 20,500 km²) declined to <em>ca</em>. 11,500 km² (56% of historic range) as of 2019, and fragmented into two populations; one in western Serengeti (last encounter in 2019; Loishooki <em>et al</em>. 2016, R. Hoare pers comm 2010, Lomo Tanzania Safari, D. Hurt G. Tolchard pers. comm 2019) and one in western Ngorongoro Conservation Area (last and only encounter in 2012; R. Knocker pers. comm 2012). The Ngorongoro Conservation Area record (Naibardat Hill), the first record of <em>E. baumstarki</em> in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, is, however, of a single encounter with what seemed to be a solitary individual (R. Knocker pers. comm. 2012). <br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for this species is somewhere between 12,300 km² (Y. de Jong &amp; T.

This monkey is hunted for meat in parts of its range and is particularly vulnerable to both snaring and shotgun hunting. Bushmeat specimens have been seen at Wanie Rukula, Pembeliba and Kindu, which might come from Lualaba in DRC (J. Hart pers. obs. 2016). Expansion of artisanal mining and shifting cultivation pose additional threats,&#160;especially in eastern DRC. Mining is of particular concern as mining operations can open up formerly remote areas to exploitation and settlement, leading to&#160;habitat loss.

Considering the species' now patchy distribution and low population densities at many sites, and that population decline in unprotected areas has been extreme, the total population of this monkey could now number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. This population decline has occurred mainly as a result of unregulated hunting, habitat loss, habitat degradation and habitat fragmentation due to agriculture, cattle-ranching, human settlement and mining. Hence, the taxon qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion A.</p>","Lowe’s Monkey has been found in a wide variety of tropical forest types, including lowland forest, gallery forest, mangroves and forest-savanna mosaic zones. It has been found in secondary forest, farmland and farmbush. <em>Cercopithecus lowei</em> is active mainly in low (&lt;5 m) forest strata and on the ground. Its locomotion is a mix of quadrupedal walking and running. Leaping and climbing are less common, and dropping is rare (Schubert 2011). Home range estimates from 1.5–40 ha were given by Bourlière <em>et al</em>. (1970). In Adiopodoumé, Côte d’Ivoire, a group varied in size from 6-16 individuals, while in Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary, Ghana, average group size was 16.6 (s.d.=3.8, N=13). <em>Cercopithecus lowei</em> has a large repertoire of vocalisations. One of the most prominent calls is the adult male's loud call, which consists of low-frequency double booms followed by a series of higher-frequency hacks (Bourlière <em>et al</em>. 1970).","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>The greatest threat to the Lowe’s Monkey is from hunting, using firearms and snares (Oates 2011, Danquah <em>et al</em>. 2012). Lowe’s Monkeys are hunted as food for personal consumption and for the bushmeat trade, and their loud vocalizations make them an easy target for hunters. A recent market survey indicated that <em>C. lowei </em>and<em> Perodicticus potto</em> are now the two top primate species found in bushmeat markets in Côte d’Ivoire (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2017), in part reflecting the scarcity of other species. The monkeys are also captured as pets, both in live-traps as adults or as young when the mother is killed for the meat trade.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and fragmentation due to conversion of forests and farmbush into cocoa, palm oil and rubber plantations is an almost equally important threat to this species. Since 2000, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana have lost 17% and 13% respectively of their forest cover (Global Forest Watch 2019). Between 1988 and 2007, at least 23,000 km² of the Upper Guinean rainforest in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana were cleared for cocoa farms, and the clearing of forests for cocoa production continues in both countries. In Côte d’Ivoire, the annual deforestation rate between 2000 and 2015 was estimated to be 2.69%, with an average forest loss of 2,500 km²/year (BNETD 2016), and many of the ~180 forest reserves in the geographic range of <em>C. lowei </em>have already been converted into plantations and human settlements. In some parts of Ghana, surface mining for gold, diamonds, bauxite and other metals also threatens the species’ survival, even in farmbush areas (E. Wiafe, pers. obs. 2015).</p><p><a name=""_GoBack""></a></p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Although firm data are lacking, the total population of this monkey could number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. <em>Cercopithecus lowei </em>now has a patchy distribution and low population densities at most of the sites where it still occurs (Gatti 2010, Danquah <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Ghana, at the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary (BFMS) in Kintampo South where the species is protected by a traditional belief system (Wong and Sicotte 2006), the population size in the BFMS proper was estimated to be 181 individuals per km² in 2012 (Elgart 2016). However, a 2009 survey of several protected areas in southwestern Ghana found <em>C. lowei</em> at low encounter rates (0.04–0.4 groups per km²; Danquah <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, the most important population is found in the Tanoé swamp forest, where a density of 11.7 groups per km² was reported by a survey conducted in 2009 (Gonedelé Bi, unpublished data), but very low encounter rates (0.03–0.33 groups per km²) were reported (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2014) for several community forests and protected areas (that have not been converted into cocoa plantations). Strong poaching pressure and habitat degradation continue in most protected areas, presenting a serious threat to the survival of of <em>C. lowei</em> populations (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Considering the foregoing information, it is evident that the total population of <em>C. lowei</em> has declined by more than 30% during the last three generations, hence qualifying this taxon for a Vulnerable threat category.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Cercopithecus lowei </em>once<em>&#160;</em>ranged from the Cavally River on the Côte d’Ivoire-Liberia border in the west to the Volta River in Ghana in the east (Oates 2011).

The habitats throughout its range have experienced ≥30% loss and degradation, and human population size in the range countries increased by 120% during the same period. The species, however, still has a wide distribution, is adaptable and can persist in some degraded habitats such as farmbush as long as hunting pressure is low or non-existent. The predicted future trajectory for populations of <em>Cercopithecus campbelli</em> is an accelerated rate of decline as larger-bodied primates are being depleted from their shared forests</p><p></p>","<p>Campbell’s Monkey is found in a wide variety of habitats, including lowland forest, gallery forest, mangroves, woodland, woody savanna and farrow lands (Oates 2011, Campbell 2013). It also occurs in secondary forest, in areas of subsistence agriculture, and in farmbush. The highest elevation area where this species occurs is the lower latitudinal locations (up to 600 m) in the Guinea Highlands. The estimated home range size for two groups in Taï NP was 52 ha and 67 ha (Buzzard and Eckardt 2007). <em>C. campbelli</em> mainly feeds on fruits and insects. In Taï NP, the diet of this species was found to be 46% fruits, 33% animal matter and 8% leaves (Buzzard 2006). Foraging for insects often involved unrolling curled-up leaves.<br/><br/>The typical group structure is a one-male group, but the species is sometimes found in multi-male groups, and all-male groups outside heterosexual groups have been observed (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985, Buzzard 2006). In Taï NP in 1976, mean group size was 11.4 individuals (5–33, N=8) (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985), but had decreased to 9.3 (N=3) in 2001 (Buzzard and Eckardt 2007). Group size in Guinea-Bissau ranged from 1–20 (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003). On Tiwai Island, mean group size recorded in 1982–1984 was 14 (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>This species is preyed upon by Leopards (<em>Panthera pardus</em>), Western Chimpanzees (<em>Pan</em> <em>troglodytes verus</em>), and Crowned Hawk-eagles (<em>Stephanoaetus coronatus</em>) (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002).</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Cercopithecus</em> <em>campbelli</em> has been impacted by, first and foremost, bushmeat hunting, and secondly, habitat loss. <br/><br/>Due to its relatively small body size, it was not a prime target for hunters until quite recently, but because the larger-bodied primates such as the Upper Guinea Red Colobus (<em>Piliocolobus badius</em>) and the King Colobus (<em>Colobus polykomos</em>) have been decimated or even extirpated from many areas due to unregulated hunting, even this small-bodied guenon (adult male ~4.5 kg) has now become a target for hunters. In Mount Nimba, Liberia, Bené <em>et al</em>. (2013) monitored hunters’ activities in 2009–2011 and found a high rate (0.7 per km) of encountering hunters carrying the carcasses of this species. In Konobo District in Liberia on the border with Côte d’Ivoire, an unsustainable level of hunting is taking place (Covey and McGraw 2014). During Tweh <em>et al</em>.’s (2015) primate surveys, conducted across Liberia in August-December 2010, hunting signs (empty cartridges, gunshots, poachers’ camps, and snares) were the most frequently observed anthropogenic signs. Due to unregulated hunting, logging and mining operations, the Lagoas de Cufada NP in Guinea-Bissau is becoming an “empty forest” (Starin 2010). Minhós <em>et al</em>.’s (2013) study using a DNA bar-coding method estimated that 1,550 individual primates, which included<em> C. campbelli</em>, sold in two markets in Guinea-Bissau, were consumed by the inhabitants during the 2010 dry season. Hunting pressure has been exacerbated by an increase of 120% in human population size in the habitat countries during the last three decades (World Bank 2019).<br/><br/>Habitat loss through deforestation and forest fragmentation is due to creation of road networks, agriculture and mining (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003, Starin 2010, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013, Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). This species once thrived in disturbed habitats and farmbush, but many of these habitats have been converted to plantations of non-native species.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Cercopithecus</em> <em>campbelli</em> is still common in some areas, although its total geographic range has been reduced by deforestation, forest fragmentation and forest conversion. In Senegal, other than the fact that this species is present in the Parc National de Basse Casamance and several forest reserves, information on this species is scarce (P.I. Ndiaye pers. comm. 2019). In Guinea-Bissau, the species is still widespread except in the highest latitudinal areas in the northeast (Limoges 1989 cited in Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013), but Bersacola <em>et al</em>.’s (2018) survey in 2015 at Dulombi and Paiai in Dulombi National Park found low encounter rates of 0.38 and 0.18 groups per km, respectively. This species is widespread and still common also in many parts of Guinea, even though hunting pressure is increasing, while many forests are fragmented and degraded (Campbell 2013, WCF 2015a).<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone,<em> C. campbelli</em> occurs at Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary (hereafter Tiwai), the Gola Forest National Park, Loma Mountains Forest Reserve (FR), Bumbuna in northern Sierra Leone, where the hydroelectric dam is being upgraded, and several other protected areas. Encounter rates vary between 0.02 to 0.54 groups per km (Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015, Ganas-Swaray <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the early 1980s, population density at Tiwai was 39-44 per km² (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Gola Forest NP, surveys made before and after the 1991–2001 civil war obtained various group sighting data (Davies 1987, Klop <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lindsell <em>et al</em>. 2011). For example, Klop <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported an average encounter rate of 0.34 groups per km for their surveys conducted between October 2005 and June 2007, but the use of different survey methods and the manner in which auditory and visual sighting data were presented in different reports make it impossible to gauge with precision any changes in population numbers of this species. Nevertheless, Lindsell <em>et al</em>. (2011) concluded that primates “continue to have healthy populations in the forest… and showed little or no sign of reduced abundance"". For this reason, the data are still insufficient to assess the current status of this species across the rest of Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>In Liberia, this species occurs in a number of protected areas including North Lorma National Park, Gola National Park, Grebo-Krahn National Park, Krahn-Bassa National Forest, and Sapo National Park. Group encounter rates obtained in the early 2000s in all of these forests were in the range of 0.10–0.33 (Waitkuwait 2003, Barrie <em>et al</em>. 2007, Vogt 2011, WCF 2015b).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire,<em> C. campbelli</em> occurs in several protected areas including Goulaleu and Krozialé Forêt Classées (FC or Classified Forests), Taï National Park, Goin-Débé FC, Cavally FC (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002, Normand 2010, Kramoko <em>et al</em>. 2017) and community forests. However, Campbell’s Monkey appears to have been extirpated from Monogaga FC, Rapide Grah FC, Mont Péko NP, Kani-Bandaman Rouge FC, Séguéla FC and Koba FC, as all were converted into cocoa plantations (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015). The most important population is found in Taï NP, where a density of 24.4 individuals per km² was reported more than 15 years ago (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002). More recent surveys conducted in Goin-Débé FC found that encounter rates had declined from 1.65 groups per km in 2007 to 1.31 in 2009–2010, and from 3.08 to 1.93 in Cavally FC (Normand 2010). Outside the protected areas in Côte d’Ivoire, this species persists even in areas where hunting occurs regularly (Soiret <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Campbell’s Monkey ranges from the Gambia and Senegal, just north of the Casamance River in the west, through Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to the Cavally River on the Côte d’Ivoire-Liberia border in the east (Oates 2011). Between the Cavally and Sassandra-Nzo Rivers in western Côte d’Ivoire is a region where individuals of this species and of <em>Cercopithecus</em> lowei occur, as well as individuals with intermediate features (Oates 1988, 2011). This species also occurs on the island of Caravela in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003).</p>","<p>Campbell’s Monkey is hunted for bushmeat in all its range countries (see Threats). It costs 2,000 CFA (equivalent of US$ 3.6 as of 2019) to purchase four or five pieces of monkey meat at a market in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau (Starin 2010), while a small individual of this species is sold for about 3,000 CFA (US$ 5.3), and an adult male for 5,000 CFA (US$ 8.8) in markets in southwestern Côte d’Ivoire (S.

Based on deforestation rates in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Ivory Coast, this species has lost at least 30% of its primary habitat over the past three generations (~1990-2018). Due to the combined negative impacts of hunting, which has resulted in the extirpation of a number of subpopulations and reduced others to levels that may not be viable over the long-term, <em>C. diana</em> numbers are suspected to have undergone a decline of 50% or more over this time period.","This largely arboreal species lives in the canopy of primary and old secondary lowland moist forest, and riverine and gallery forests. It is rare in degraded forest, but it appears that it can survive in lightly-logged forest where the canopy is relatively intact. This species occurs from just above sea level in Sierra Leone to at least 1,300 m asl in the Loma Mountains, Sierra Leone. Diana Monkeys feed mainly on fruits, arthropods and flowers; leaves become seasonally important when other items are less available (Buzzard 2006, Whitesides 1989). They spend much of their time in association with other primate species, which may be an anti-predator strategy (Whitesides 1991, Noë and Bshary 1997). Humans are the main predators on Diana Monkeys (Koné and Refisch 2007, McGraw 2007). Other important predators include Chimpanzees (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>), Leopards (<em>Panthera pardus</em>), and African Crowned Eagles (<em>Stephanoatus coronatus</em>) (Boesch and Boesch 1989, Shultz and Noë 2007, Oates 2011).","<em></em><em>Cercopithecus diana</em> is threatened by hunting, and habitat degradation and loss.<br/><br/>The relatively large body size of this species and the value of its meat and skin make it a preferred game species across its range in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Subsistence hunting is widespread and laws against commercial hunting  and other illegal activities (mining, habitat encroachment) inside  protected areas are poorly enforced throughout the <em>C. diana</em> range. The increasing scale of commercial hunting poses the greatest  threat (Béné<em> et al</em>., 2013c; Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). Although Diana Monkeys adopt certain behaviours to minimize mortality due to hunting (Bshary 2001, Koné and Refisch 2007), they are now rarely  found in areas with high hunting pressure, compared to areas where  hunting pressure is relatively low (N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Côte d’Ivoire, the species has been extirpated from almost all the  protected areas within its Extent of Occurrence (&gt;80%).<br/><br/>In addition to hunting pressure, large-scale deforestation in the  region, through mining, logging, conversion to agricultural land and  charcoal production, continues to reduce the habitat available to this  species (McGraw 1998, Tweh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015, WCF 2015).&#160; Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea each lost between 14 and 21% of their  total forest cover between 2001 and 2017, and dominant drivers of loss  continue (<a href=""https://www.globalforestwatch.org/"">www.globalforestwatch.org</a>).<br/><br/>Combining the significant loss of suitable habitat with intense poaching  pressure, it is suspected that the total  population of <em>C. diana</em> has declined by more than 50% during the last three generations<em>.&#160;</em>","<em>Cercopithecus diana</em> is now a rare and declining species throughout most of its range. Populations are affected by habitat loss through agricultural expansion (cocoa, oil palm, rubber, rice), intensive commercial logging, and by hunting for bushmeat (Lindsell <em>et al</em>. 2011; Gonedele Bi <em>et al</em>. 2012; Béné <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b,c; Covey and McGraw 2014; Greengrass 2016). In Côte d’Ivoire, the species has been extirpated from almost all (&gt;80%) the protected areas within its extent of occurrence (EOO). In the Taï NP where a viable population occurs, an estimated 97,000 individuals were reported in 2006-2008 based on survey data (N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012); a number that has almost certainly declined since that time. Within Taï NP, Diana Monkey abundance is strongly influenced by hunting pressure and this monkey is nearly 100 times more common near research stations and tourist sites than areas where hunting is unchecked (N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012). Outside Taï NP, a 2007-2010 biomonitoring survey reported the species in two reserves (Cavally, Goin-Debe) at a very low encounter rate (0.08–0.2 grp/km) with a decrease in the encounter rate ranging from 0.2 to 0.16 grp/km in Cavally FR and 0.08 to 0 grp/km in Goin Debe FR (WCF 2010). The ongoing hunting pressure, habitat encroachment and human settlement with these forest reserves pose severe threat to the survival of remaining populations. Currently, viable populations are found in Tiwaï Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Gola Forest National Park and Loma Mountains National Park in Sierra Leone; Sapo National Park in Liberia. Surveys within the Grebo-Sapo Corridor of southeastern Liberia reported a Diana Monkey encounter rate (N/km) of 0.31 (Furnell <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Large-scale deforestation in the region, through logging, conversion to agricultural land and charcoal production, continues to reduce the habitat available to this species, especially in Côte d’Ivoire (McGraw 1998, McGraw and Oates 2007, Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015). Between 2001 and 2017, Côte d’Ivoire is estimated to have lost 17% of its tree cover (Global Forest Watch 2019) and this loss has been exacerbated by a large increase in the human population in the southern forest zone and the spread of cocoa farming, including illegal cocoa cultivation within protected areas (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015,&#160;Higonnet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). In Ghana, hunting for the commercial bushmeat trade has decimated populations of Roloway Monkeys; recent surveys have failed to find any surviving groups in two national parks (Bia and Nini-Suhien) and in several forest reserves where it formerly occurred (Gatti 2010, Oates 1999, Osei <em>et al</em>. 2015).

It is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation due to shifting agriculture and human settlements, and large parts of its geographic range are exploited by artisanal miners, thus its population is likely to be decreasing.","<em>C. denti </em>is a small, arboreal guenon that occurs across a wide range of forest types. In the core of its geographic range, it lives in low- to mid-elevation tropical forest, including closed primary mixed forest, secondary and riverine forest (Thomas 1991). In the eastern part of its range, it occurs in submontane to montane forests up to 2,000 m asl, and sometimes occurs at 2,400 m (Detwiler pers. obs. 2004–2005).<p><em>C. denti</em> is yet to be the focus of a systematic behavioural ecology study, but its diet is mostly fruit and arthropod prey (Thomas 1991), and Kingdon (2015) adds flowers, caterpillars, shoots and leaves.

Field biologists have identified fresh kills of <em>C. denti</em> along trade routes to the Kindu and Kisangani markets (Hart pers. obs. 2016, Hicks pers. obs. 2016). A bushmeat study conducted in the main market in Kisangani documented a significant increase in the hunting of small diurnal monkeys, including <em>Cercopithecus</em>, from 2002 to 2008–2009 (2,221 and 8,228 carcasses, respectively) (van Vliet <em>et al</em>. 2012). During both study periods, the two main trade routes for carcasses entering the Kisangani market were Ituri and Lubutu (van Vliet <em>et al</em>. 2012), both of which are core forest areas for <em>C. denti</em>. In a second, more recent study, which investigated urban and rural bushmeat&#160;consumption in the greater Kisangani region, small monkeys were among the top three types of bushmeat reported to be preferred and eaten by children (van Vliet <em>et al</em>. 2014).<em><br/><br/>Cercopithecus denti</em> is likely also sold in bushmeat markets in the southeastern part of the range, the South Kivu area, but it is difficult to confirm species identity, as the carcasses are sold without skin as “monkey” (K. Guschanski pers. comm. 2016). In this area, the Centre de Rehabilitation des Primates de Lwiro cares for wildlife confiscated by park rangers and conservationists, and <em>C. denti</em> is one of the monkey species living at Lwiro (K. Guschanski pers. comm. 2016). The most likely reason for the presence of this species at Lwiro is that young <em>C. denti </em>are captured by hunters when the mother is killed.<br/><br/>Expanding artisanal mining poses a growing threat to <em>C. denti</em> over large areas of its geographic range – in Maniema, North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri and&#160;Haut-Uélé provinces – and illegal mining is established in several of the largest protected areas that support populations of this species, notably Kahuzi-Biega and Maiko national parks, and Okapi Wildlife Reserve. Mining sites that occur far from established roads and villages pose a particularly significant threat, as these sites are often provisioned by resident bushmeat hunters who target primates.<br/><br/>In addition to an increase in hunting pressure,&#160;<em>C. denti</em>&#160;is impacted in parts of its range by habitat loss through deforestation, agriculture and human settlement (Potapov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). Increased rates of deforestation are also associated with artisanal mining in eastern DRC (Butsic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>","<p><em>Cercopithecus denti</em> is likely common throughout the core area of its range.

South of Ituri, Hall <em>et al.</em> (2003) reported <em>C. denti</em> population densities of 12.55 and 17.34 individuals per&#160;km²&#160;at two survey sites in the Itebero lowland sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP; survey data collected 1994–1995). Despite ongoing security issues, encroachment by artisanal miners, and human settlement in the lowland sector of KBNP, <em>C. denti</em>’s occurrence was confirmed in a survey of the Itebero sector in 2012, and in the Kasese sector of the park in 2013 (K.

The species’ western limit is thought to be the lower Itimbiri River (Sarmiento and Kingdon 2013). In a series of primate surveys in northern DRC, <em>C. denti </em>was not encountered at any of the eight sites north of the Uélé River, but was observed at three sites (Aketi-Akuma, Buta and Lebo) north of the upper Itimbiri/Rubi River (Hicks pers. obs. 2004–2008).

The population in Magombera, in Kilombera Valley, was severely affected by the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (in 1972–1975) which bisected Magombera Forest, and through selective logging and agricultural expansion. The presence of the railway facilitated agricultural encroachment into the reserve, and increased the number of bush fires. Agriculture was responsible for a decline in the reserve’s size from 15 km² in 1955 to less than 11 km² by 1979. The area was threatened with total destruction in 2002 when the Government of Tanzania agreed to relocate squatters there from the nearby Kilombero Sugar Estate. Fortunately, the international conservation community appealed to the Government of Tanzania, which averted destruction of the forest, which contains &gt;1,000 red colobus (Struhsaker 2005).&#160;</p>  <p>The local Wahehe people hunt <em>P. gordonorum</em>, particularly in the western and south-western parts of the range (Struhsaker <em>et al</em>. 2013).

Rovero, unpubl. data).</p>","<p>The total population of <em>Piliocolobus gordonorum</em> is difficult to determine with precision due to the many difficulties of counting arboreal primates (Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2008), but it is clearly in the tens of thousands. Efforts to census the species using systematic distance sampling have increased steadily in recent years. Rovero <em>et al</em>. (2009) reviewed existing knowledge and proposed population sizes ranging between 25,000 and 35,000 individuals. Araldi <em>et al</em>. (2014) conducted systematic transect censuses in four major forest blocks (Magombera, Matundu, Mwanihana and Uzungwa Scarp) estimated 45,000–50,000 individuals using distance sampling. These authors, however, did not consider variations in detectability (due to group size, habitat structure, etc.) and density (due to habitat and human disturbance factors), which are important for obtaining precise estimates (Cavada <em>et al</em>. 2016). The large Ndundulu-Luhomero forest may also contain thousands of individuals, given that the encounter rate from a recent survey across Ndundulu averaged 0.59 groups/km walked (N. Cavada and F. Rovero unpubl. data), which is within the upper side of the range of values recorded in other forests (0.08–0.62 groups/km walked; Araldi <em>et al</em>. 2014). In conclusion, while a precise estimate is still unavailable, the total population of <em>P. gordonorum</em> likely ranges between 30,000–40,000 individuals. Yet, some populations, such as in Uzungwa Scarp are under heavy pressure from poaching and are in rapid decline (see below and Rovero <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Piliocolobus gordonorum</em> is restricted to the Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania, including Udzungwa Mountains National Park and several adjacent forests, most of which have protected status as a Forest Reserve (FR) or a Nature Reserve (NR) status: Kilombero NR, Matundu FR, Uzungwa Scarp NR, Nyanganje FR, Kiranzi-Kitungulu and New Dabaga/Ulangambi (Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2010, Jones 2013, Struhsaker <em>et al</em>. 2013).

Forests directly to the north and east of Korup NP have been and continue to be selectively logged, as have forests in the Makombe-Ndokbou area. One of the most exploited timber species in southwestern Cameroon is <em>Lophira alata</em> (Namuene 2014), a tree species that red colobus monkeys rely on for food. Large-scale industrial oil-palm plantations located adjacent to Korup NP and Ebo Forest threaten the integrity of forests in both areas.</p>  <p>Underlying these threats is an increasing human population, leading to increasing demands for bushmeat and other natural resources. The human population growth rate in Cameroon and Nigeria is high and has been increasing from ~2.0% annual growth rate in the early 1960s to 2.6% in 2017–2018 (World Bank 2019).&#160;</p>  <p>The so-called “Anglophone Crisis” in the South West and North West Regions of Cameroon further exacerbates the threats listed above. Since 2017, conservation activities in Korup NP (SW Region) have been suspended due to civil unrest, which has forced a substantial proportion of the human population to flee into the forest. This has likely led to increased pressure on forest resources in and around Korup NP, including increased hunting of red colobus monkeys.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Based on extrapolation of a known number of groups in a circumscribed area in southern Korup National Park and an average group size of 24–33 individuals, there are estimated to be between ~3,300 and 4,600 red colobus monkeys in Korup NP, the remaining stronghold for this species (J. Linder and C. Astaras, unpublished data 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Sighting frequency of <em>Piliocolobus preussi</em> in northeastern and southern Korup is relatively low and has declined through time.

These are considered ‘monsoon forests’, receiving over 10,000 mm of rain per year (Oates <em>et al</em>. 2004). This monkey is reported to occur from sea level through montane forests into Schefflera forests at elevations of 1,800 m or higher (Butynski and Koster 1994, González-Kirchner 1997); however, Cronin <em>et al</em>. (<em>in review</em>) observed it from only 0–1,200 m, and suggested that they are likely not found higher than that based on habitat suitability modelling.</p><p>Abundance of <em>P. pennantii</em> is concentrated in the southwestern region, and especially in the lowland forests near Playa Moraka (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2016, Cronin <em>et al</em>. <em>in review</em>), which suggests that it may have a preference for lowland tropical moist forest, contrary to González-Kirchner (1997), who suggested it preferred montane forest. It is locally abundant in parts of its range (e.g., the forests near Playa Moraka), but abundance drops significantly outside core areas (Cronin <em>et al</em>. <em>in review</em>).</p><p>Group size is variable. In a brief survey, Struhsaker (2000) estimated that group size ranged from 5–30 animals, with a mean of 14 individuals. Using data from 506 encounters; however, Cronin <em>et al</em>. (in review) observed a maximum group size of 20 individuals and a mean group size of 2.85 animals (2.64–3.07) across its entire range, and 3.08 animals (2.71–3.52) in the crater of the Gran Caldera, where primate populations are most likely as close to ‘natural’ as is possible on Bioko due to isolation and very low hunting pressure.</p>","<p>The major threats to this species are hunting (e.g., Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2015b, 2016), development and habitat degradation.</p>  <p>Cronin <em>et al</em>. (2015b) reported that 1,754 individuals were available in the Malabo bushmeat market between 1997 and 2010. <em>P. pennantii</em> was hunted at a lower rate than most of the other diurnal primate species due to its isolated distribution in remote areas of the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve. It is, however, the primate species most vulnerable diurnal&#160;to hunting pressure on Bioko (Cronin <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>  <p>Hunting has continued unabated in the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve<em> </em>since 2010 (e.g., Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2016), and the recent completion of a road bisecting the reserve has eroded much of the isolation that had passively protected wildlife populations (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2015a), and contributed to increased hunting activity in the reserve (D.T. Cronin, unpublished data, 2015, 2016).</p>  <p>There are also plans for a significantly greater military presence in the near future at Ureca, the only village entirely within the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve, and construction of a large base is already underway to accommodate its personnel. This represents a potentially grave threat for <em>P. pennantii</em> and other wildlife in the reserve, as Cronin <em>et al</em>. (2016) reported that military staff in Ureca were the only gun owners and perpetrators of gun-hunting in the area around the village at the time of the study (2011–2012). This situation is still generally the case, but hunting activity has been augmented by hunters from outside the reserve visiting the area to hunt as a result of the road (D.T. Cronin, pers. obs. 2015, 2016). An increased number of arms and military personnel at Ureca are very likely to lead to increased hunting of primates, including <em>P. pennantii</em>.</p>","<p>There are probably fewer than 1,200 animals remaining on Bioko, and Cronin <em>et al</em>. (<em>in review</em>) estimate a &gt;80% decline in numbers between 1986 and 2016.</p>  <p><em>Piliocolobus pennantii</em> is encountered at a rate of 0.26 groups/km (3.92 groups/km²)&#160;on Bioko, but abundance is highly localised (Cronin <em>et al</em>. <em>in review</em>). At Moraka in the remote southwest, abundance was 0.49 groups/km, but at Ureca near the limit of its range, abundance was 0.16 groups/km. Hunting and recent road development and the associated increasing in anthropogenic disturbance in the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve are contributing to declining population numbers and a reduction in its extent of occurrence.<br/><br/>A past reduction of more than 80% is suspected over the last three generations based on bushmeat hunting and market surveys (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016) and the fact that this species is most favoured by bushmeat hunters.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Piliocolobus pennantii</em><strong> </strong>is endemic to the island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea, where it is now restricted entirely to the southwest of the island with a range of approximately 160 km² in the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve (Cronin <em>et al</em>. <em>in review</em>). <em>P. pennantii </em>was thought to have persisted in the Iladyi valley in southeastern Bioko until recently, and in Pico Basilé National Park in northern Bioko into the early 1990s (Butynski and Koster 1994, González-Kirchner 1994, IUCN 2016), but there have been no records in subsequent studies in either area (Nowak and Rioso Etingue 2007, Butynski and Owens 2008, Grande-Vega <em>et al</em>. 2013, Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2013, Cronin 2014) and interviews with hunters who have worked extensively on Pico Basilé report not having seen it for ≥30 years (M. Grande Vega, unpublished data). Earlier reports detailed <em>P. pennantii</em> at elevations ranging from 0-800 m and potentially up to 1,800 m (Butynski and Koster 1994, González-Kirchner 1997), but Cronin <em>et al</em>. (<em>in review</em>) estimate its current elevational range is more likely between 0-1,200 m.","<p>From 1997 to 2010, 1,754 <em>Piliocolobus pennantii</em> carcasses were available for sale in the Malabo bushmeat market (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2015b). During the final period of the survey (November 2007 through September 2010), the average change in the rate of <em>P. pennantii</em> carcass availability per month was increasing by approximately one carcass/month, i.e., the general offtake pattern was gradually increasing. The average price paid in the Malabo market for an adult <em>P. p. pennantii</em> in 2008 was about US$50 (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><em>P. pennantii</em> receives some measure of protection under both national and international legislation. Its population is entirely within a legally-recognised protected area (IUCN 1b Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve), in which hunting is prohibited (Republic of Equatorial Guinea 2003). Furthermore, the hunting, sale and consumption of all primates was banned by Presidential Decree in October 2007 (Republic of Equatorial Guinea 2007). However, there is no management plan in place for the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve, and the National Institute for Forestry Development and Protected Area Management (INDEFOR-AP) has a very limited budget, with few staff and low capacity with which to effectively manage the reserve. Internationally, this taxon is also listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.</p>  <p>The remaining populations of <em>P. pennantii</em> on Bioko are confined to approximately 160 km² Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve (510 km²); however, there is almost no control of hunting in these protected areas.</p>  <p>Butynski and Koster (1994) provided the contemporary baseline for the status of Bioko’s primates, including <em>P. pennanti</em>, and there has been continual monitoring of primate populations on Bioko by the Bioko Biodiversity Protection Program (BBPP) since the early 2000s (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006, Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2010). More recently, there have been numerous systematic survey efforts throughout Bioko, especially in the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve, in order to assess primate abundance and hunting intensity (e.g., Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2016), including targeted surveys for <em>P. pennantii</em> (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2013). This work has led to an increased understanding of the distribution and population density of <em>P. pennantii</em> and shed light on both the threats it faces and the urgent need for effective measures to protect the species (Cronin <em>et al</em>. 2017, <em>in review</em>).</p>  <p>In order to effectively conserve primates on Bioko, Cronin <em>et al</em>. (2017) have proposed (i) the development and implementation of a management plan for the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve; (ii) the strengthening of the legal basis for protection and management of the GCSR; (iii) greater involvement of INDEFOR-AP in the GCSR; (iv) increased enforcement; and (v) a more proactive government approach to conservation, especially towards primate hunting. Also called for is a ban on shotgun hunting, as has been argued before (Albrechtsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2006), as well as the implementation of bushmeat spot checks at existing checkpoints at key transit intersections. An area-based prioritization scheme was also recently developed using primate species richness as its basis (Cronin <em>et al</em>. <em>in review</em>), in which the ‘critical zone’ will encompass almost all of the range of <em>P. pennantii</em>. The ‘critical zone’ delineation has been adopted into the Equatoguinean ‘National Biodiversity Strategy &amp; Action Plan for the Conservation of Biological Diversity’ (Engonga Osono <em>et al</em>. 2015); however, the completion of this plan has not yet resulted in the development of a comprehensive management plan for the reserve, nor has the plan bolstered government support for its conservation.</p>  The BBPP has many projects underway in the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve, including primate monitoring, alternative livelihoods, educational programmes, professional development training (i.e., ecoguard training), the development of a Nature Centre in the village of Ureca, and partnering with INDEFOR-AP to foment their active involvement in the reserve and its day-to-day management. A United Nations Development Programme (UNEP) Global Environmental Facility (GEF) project is also ongoing on the island with the goal of strengthening Equatorial Guinea’s system of protected areas.

It persists in small pockets of fragmented and degraded forest but has been extirpated from most parts of the area where it was previously reported to be present (Ikemeh 2015).&#160;<em>Piliocolobus epieni</em> does not occur in any formal protected area, and although some conservation efforts have been attempted they have been significantly hampered by insecurity in the Niger Delta, a lack of political will, and a lack of consensus amongst key local communities over the scope of proposed conservation programmes. Therefore the decline of the species is expected to continue. Immediate conservation attention is required if <em>P. epieni</em> is to be saved from extinction.","It is a largely arboreal species restricted to freshwater swamp forest. Its diet is dominated by young foliage from large and medium-sized trees, with seeds being seasonally important. The Niger Delta red colobus flourishes only in areas where their favoured food trees occur in large patches (Werre 2000), and their populations are therefore very sensitive to the loss of these trees.","The major threats to this species are habitat degradation and loss; hunting is reported to be relatively rare and opportunistic (Ikemeh 2015).  Artisanal-scale logging has seriously degraded the habitat of <em>P. epieni</em>, removing many important red colobus food trees, such as <strong><em>Hallea ledermannii</em></strong> (Werre and Powell 1997, Grubb and Powell 1999). These threats have further intensified during the last decade as a result of growing human population and migration, and increased economic activities accompanied by a rise in income levels. A survey in 2013 found that many of the forests across the range of <em>P. epieni </em>now lacked any large trees, and that even medium-sized trees were scarce, while an analysis of remote-sensing imagery indicated annual rate of forest loss across this range of 1.2% between 1991 and 2013 &#160;(Ikemeh 2015)","<em>Piliocolobus epieni</em> was discovered only in 1993, and was then quite common within its limited range, but surveys over the following 15 years suggested significant declines as a result of habitat loss and degradation from logging, and from hydrological changes resulting from oil industry activities (Werre and Powell 1997, Grubb and Powell 1999, M. Isoun and D. Otobo pers. comm. 2009). A survey in 2013 found no evidence (from sightings and local reports) for the presence of Niger Delta Red Colobus at 10 of the16 sites where Werre (2000) had recorded their presence in the mid-1990s (Ikemeh 2015). The current population may now only number in the hundreds (Ikemeh 2015).",Decreasing,"The historical range of <em>Piliocolobus epieni</em> extended from the Forcados-Nikrogha Creek and the Sagbama-Osiama-Agboi Creek in the marsh forest of the Niger Delta, Nigeria (Grubb and Powell 1999, Werre 2000).

Additional sites have also been proposed that could protect viable populations of the species (Ikemeh 2015), but there has been a lack of political will to implement these recommendations. Conservation efforts have also been hampered at a local level, particularly in the Apoi Creek area, where key communities have disagreed over land rights and the scope of conservation programmes that can be implemented.

92657454,92657343,Piliocolobus semlikiensis,Vulnerable,A2cd,2020,2020-01-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Piliocolobus semlikiensis</em> has an extent of occurrence of ~78,500 km² and an area of occupation of ~54,400 km², but forest loss is ongoing across its range. Total forest loss is estimated at 4,430 km² (8.1% of the range) over 17 years (2001–2018; GFW 2019), which is 1.7 generations for this monkey (generation time for the genus is estimated at 10 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species occurs in eastern DRC, where the rate of forest cover loss is increasing: since 2014, it has been ~1% per year. Prior to that, annually rate of loss was 0.25–0.4% (GFW 2019).<br/><br/>Projecting backwards three generations (to 1990) goes beyond the last 17 years for which forest loss data are available; however, we know that forest loss was occurring before 2001. Extrapolating 0.25-0.4% annual loss to the decade 1990–2000 gives an additional 2.5-4%&#160; lost. Therefore, we estimate an overall range loss of 12–14% between 1990 and 2020.<br/><br/>Added to forest loss is increasing hunting for bushmeat. Monkey meat is eaten in rural locations and traded commercially for consumption in towns and cities, and the bushmeat trade is a serious threat to red colobus monkeys across Central Africa (Struhsaker 2010). Red colobus are targeted for because of their large size, which affords a good return to a hunter for the cost of a shotgun cartridge. Red colobus live in relatively large groups (Struhsaker and Grubb 2013), and their behaviour when faced with a hunter tends to be to observe rather than flee – which affords very easy, multiple targets for the hunter. Hunting pressure was high throughout the areas surveyed in the last few years: Maiko National Park (Amsini <em>et al</em>. 2006a,b), Usala (S. Nixon pers. comm. 2019) and Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Vosper <em>et al</em>. 2012, Madidi <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In 2019, there were roughly three times more people in DRC than in 1990 (mean human population growth 1990–2018 was ~3% annually). In addition, once intact blocks of forest are increasingly fragmented and made far more accessible to hunters: in DRC, 4.2% of forests classified as intact were lost between 2000–2013 (Potapov <em>et al</em>. 2017). Finally, the ability of the ever-increasing proportion of urban dwellers to pay much higher prices for bushmeat has created a highly lucrative market for commercial hunters, driving ever more rapid extraction of bushmeat from the regions’ forests. At present, 44% of the human population in DRC lives in towns and cities (World Bank 2019), compared with 27% in 1980, and this upward trend has been the case since 1960 (when it was 22%).<br/><br/>Because red colobus monkeys are large-bodied and bring a higher profit per cartridge than smaller species, it is preferentially selected by hunters and tends to be eliminated or at least greatly reduced in abundance before other, smaller monkeys. Red colobus now appear to be very rare, even in protected areas.<br/><br/>Thus, there is a combination of 12–14% of total habitat loss, plus 4.2% loss of intact forest, plus the increased demand for bushmeat, plus increased access too remote areas and an increased incentive for hunters to supply bushmeat to towns and cities. <em>Piliocolobus semlikiensis </em>is therefore suspected to have undergone a population decline exceeding 30% during the past three generations (1990–2019). The taxon is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd, as the decline has been ongoing for some time and will continue into the future; causes have not ceased (indeed, the intensity of the causes is increasing), nor will they in the foreseeable future.","Little is known of this species but all observations have been in forest habitats – terra firma, swamp forests and along rivers. The animals live in groups. It is assumed, that like other red colobus, they are primarily folivores.","The Semliki Red Colobus is directly threatened by habitat loss and hunting, and indirectly by the creation of easy access routes into huge areas of previously remote forests and increasing human populations.<br/><br/>The species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush,” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. (2016) and Harris <em>et al</em>. (2017). In DRC, over 90% of forest loss is due to shifting agriculture (Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. 2018). Since 2001, there has been a trend towards gradually increasing annual forest loss, especially since 2013–2014 (GFW 2019).<br/><br/>Hunting for bushmeat is increasing throughout the range. The meat is eaten by rural populations, traded to miners (Spira <em>et al</em>. 2019), or sold in urban markets. Road access into once-remote forests – even around protected areas – has hugely increased during the last 20–30 years (Kleinschroth <em>et al</em>. 2019), facilitating increased hunting and transport of bushmeat for commercial trade in both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2016; Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Human populations in the range of the taxon are growing at roughly 2.7% annually, and this rate will not slow down in the near future (United Nations 2019, World Bank 2019).","<p>The Semliki Red Colobus is targeted by hunters due to its large size. In recent years, they have rarely been seen, despite intensive survey efforts. They were recorded eight times in Maiko National Park in 2005 (both in the north and the south of the park: 380 and 300 km of effort, respectively; Amsini <em>et al</em>. 2006a,b). In 2007, red colobus vocalisations were heard on three separate transects close to the Ituri River (which forms the limit between <em>P. semlikiensis </em>and <em>P. oustaleti</em>), but which side of the river the vocalisations emanated from was unclear (WCS unpubl. data 2005–2007). Also in 2007, they were seen only once in the Usala area (which lies between Maiko National Park and Tayna Natural Reserve), although teams walked over 200 km of recces (Nixon <em>et al</em>. 2007). In the past, two groups were observed in Virunga National Park (Struhsaker 2010), but they were not recorded during surveys of the Semliki forest, Virunga National Park in 2008 (S. Nixon pers. comm. 2019) – the site of the taxon’s type locality. Finally, they were not found in Mt. Hoyo Reserve by Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2015), but were apparently recorded in that area in 2018 (D. Kujirakwinja pers. comm. 2019).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"The geographic range (area of occurrence) of <em>Piliocolobus semlikiensis </em>covers approximately 54,400 km². This is a forest-dwelling, Central African taxon and the vast majority of its range is in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) although, given the known distribution, it is possible that they could (rarely) occur in the contiguous forests of Semuliki and Rwenzori national parks, western Uganda. However, they were not recorded in Semuliki during a recent survey (Nixon et al. 2019) and there are no records in Rwenzori to date.<br/><br/>The southern limit of <em>P. semlikiensis </em>is roughly 1° S, comprising the Lowa River (to the southwest) and further east, its tributary, the Oso River. The northern limit is roughly 1.2° N, comprising the Nduye River (at the northeastern edge of the range of this taxon), which then runs west and joins the Ituri River that in turn becomes the Aruwimi River, which completes the northern limit. The eastern limit is the Albertine Rift, especially the northern sector of Virunga National Park, with a possible extension into Uganda, as noted above. The western limit is unclear but can be described as a very rough north-south line veering west towards the south at about 27.9° E. The reason for this vague boundary is that this taxon, as defined here, incorporates what has been described as a “hybrid swarm”, flanked to the west by <em>P. langi </em>and to the south by <em>P. lulindicus </em>and <em>P. foai</em>, with possible contribution from <em>P. oustaleti </em>in the north.",<p>The species is illegally hunted for local consumption and sale to bushmeat markets.

92659769,18252,Piliocolobus foai,Endangered,A2cd,2020,2020-01-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered, based on a precipitous reduction in extent of occurrence (EOO) in the past 30 years that is expected to continue into the future. <em>Piliocolobus foai </em>is threatened by uncontrolled hunting and habitat loss in an area that has seen high levels of civil unrest in the past 30 years. The geographic range described by Colyn (1991) was approximately ~23,000 km². Since then, surveys have shown that this species remains in only two small and isolated populations and currently has an EOO of ~6,700 km², representing a 70% decline since the range was defined in the 1990s. Furthermore, only a single sighting was recorded between 2003 and 2019 in for one of the populations (D. Kujirakwinja pers. comm. 2019). Given past trends of uncontrolled hunting that have not stopped, it is extremely likely that <em>P. foai </em>will be extirpated from Itombwe Nature Reserve in the near future, if it even still exists there.<br/><br/>The two known locations for <em>P. foai </em>are 1) Kabobo and Ngandja Reserves and adjacent Luama Hunting Reserve (together comprising the Kabobo Massif protected area complex) where it occupies an area of forest of about 1,200 km²; and 2) Itombwe Nature Reserve, where numbers have declined dramatically during the past 30 years due to habitat loss and hunting.<br/><br/><em>Piliocolobus foai</em> has not been recorded in Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the past three decades, and is thought to be no longer present in this area.<br/><br/>The Kabobo Massif, the location of the only confirmed population, has had low levels of human impact; it has been protected historically because civil conflicts meant that human settlement in the region has been low (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). Establishment of the Kabobo Massif protected area complex (Rainforest Trust 2016) has contributed significantly to the conservation of Foa's Red Colobus. Nevertheless, human populations are currently increasing in the area. Hunting and habitat degradation associated with artisanal mining are occurring, particularly in Luama Hunting Reserve (A. Plumptre and D. Kujirakwinja pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>In addition to habitat loss, a major threat is hunting: <em>P. foai </em>is targeted for bushmeat across its range. Because red colobus monkeys are large-bodied and bring a higher profit per cartridge than smaller species, they are preferentially selected by hunters and tend to be eliminated or at least greatly reduced in abundance before other, smaller monkeys. They live in relatively large groups (Struhsaker 2010, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013), and they have a tendency to observe humans rather than flee – which affords hunter with very easy, multiple targets. Hunting pressure was high in all areas surveyed in the recent past, and is associated with the expansion of artisanal mining and insecurity during periods of civil unrest.<br/><br/>Monkeys are eaten in villages and traded commercially for consumption in towns and cities; the bushmeat trade is a serious threat to red colobus monkeys across Africa (Struhsaker 2010). In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), there were approximately three times more people in 2019 than in 1990 (3% mean annual human population growth in DRC 1990–2018). The ability to pay much higher prices for bushmeat by the increasing proportion of urban dwellers in DRC has created a highly lucrative market for commercial hunters, which is the increasing rate of bushmeat extraction. At present, 44% of the human population in DRC lives in towns and cities (World Bank 2019), compared with 27% in 1980, and this upward trend has been the case since 1960 (when it was 22%). Given the human population growth, increasing human access to previously intact forest, uncontrolled hunting and the vulnerability of red colobus to hunting, this species is expected to continue declining.<br/><br/><em>Piliocolobus foai</em> is listed as Endangered under criterion A2cd due to a 70% decline in its extent of occurrence (EOO) in the recent past and hunting for bushmeat. The causes are not reversible, have not ceased, nor will they in the foreseeable future.","<p>                   </p><p><em>Piliocolobus foai</em> occurs in primary montane and submontane forest from 800 to 2,270 m asl. In Itombwe, it is restricted to evergreen closed forests; in Kabobo, it also occurs in adjoining gallery forests on the escarpment above Lake Tanganyika. It is not known to range far into gallery forests or the forest islands west of the escarpment (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/></p><p></p>","<em>Piliocolobus foai</em> populations have been reduced or extirpated from over 50% of the species’ range by hunting and by range loss due to habitat conversion and degradation during the past 30 years. Hunting certainly contributed to the loss of the taxon from KBNP, and remains a threat in Itombwe Nature Reserve, where the species is now apparently almost extirpated.<br/><br/>For the past two decades, eastern DRC has been the theatre of entrenched conflict promulgated by a multiplicity of rural militias, a number of whom are based in the region’s protected areas, including Itombwe Nature Reserve and the Kabobo Massif. This has not had an entirely negative impact. Rebels based in the Kabobo Massif prevented widespread occupation by farmers, herders and miners for two decades from the late 1970s through the fall of the Mobutu regime in 1997 (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). As security returned, incursions in the landscape increased (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Elsewhere, however, occupation by militias and brigands has made management and protection of these protected areas difficult or impossible, favouring resource extraction and use by hunters, miners and pastoralists.<br/><br/>Outside protected areas, habitat loss and degradation are due primarily to shifting cultivation and smallholder farming, small-scale logging, charcoal production and conversion of forest to pastures. Deforestation in DRC increased by a factor of 2.5 between 2011 and 2017 (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss and associated degradation has been particular severe in the range of <em>P. foai</em>, the region of DRC where human population densities are highest.<br/><br/>Small-scale (artisanal) and industrial-scale mining threaten the remaining forests in eastern DRC. Notably in the Itombwe Massif, where artisanal miners have reached even the most remote areas of this site. Since 2011, a major Canadian-registered, international gold mining company, Banro, has been operating concessions totalling 2,616 km² in and around Itombwe, and the company has outstanding requests for prospection within the boundaries of the Nature Reserve (Thierry Regards 2019).<br/><br/>In the Kabobo Massif, fires set for hunting and to clear land for agriculture are among the main threats to the evergreen montane forests favoured by <em>P. foai </em>(Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016).","<p>                   </p>No population estimates are available for <em>P. foai</em>, which has a restricted range that is threatened by habitat degradation and hunting.<br/><br/>The species was described as uncommon in the Itombwe Massif in the early 1990s (Doumenge and Schliter 1997). It was recorded in 1996 in lower montane formations between 1,220 and 1,850 m asl by Omari <em>et al</em>. (1999), who noted low overall encounter rates of primates in the massif (0.1 groups/km) and widespread evidence of hunting. Subsequent surveys and patrols between 2003 and 2019 yielded only a single observation of <em>P. foai </em>from Itombwe (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2010, D. Kujirakwinja pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Rahm and Christiaensen (1963) and Rahm (1964) reported the species in what are now the highland sector and corridor of Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP). Specimens attributed to <em>P. foai </em>were collected in this same region (Colyn 1991); however, there are no recent records of this species from surveys in this area (Inogwabini <em>et al</em>. 2001, Spira <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The last remaining stronghold for <em>P. foai </em>is the Kabobo Massif Reserve Complex, where it was recorded several times during surveys conducted in 2008 (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is threatened here, nonetheless, and rare in the Luama Hunting Reserve (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"Endemic to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), <em>Piliocolobus foai </em>(<em>sensu stricto</em>, Colyn 1991) is restricted to montane forest habitats and does not occur west of the Albertine Rift highlands in areas of lower elevation. Historically, the species’ ranged through montane and submontane forests (900–2,800 m asl) in the Albertine Rift, from Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP), south through the Itombwe Massif to Mt Kabobo (Rahm 1964). Colyn (1991) suggested, although without confirmed specimens, that <em>P. foai</em> ranged south to the Lukuga River (800 m asl); however, there is now very little if any remaining suitable habitat in this region, which borders on the city of Kalemie. Specimens from Irangi, west of the KBNP highlands, have been attributed to P. ellioti (Rahm and Christiaensen 1963). West of the Albertine Rift highland forests, red colobus populations show intergradation between <em>P. foai </em>and <em>P. lulindicus </em>and possibly other forms, and are considered to be hybrids (Colyn 1991).<br/><br/><em>Piliocolobus foai</em> is currently known from only two widely-separated locations. In the Kabobo region, it occurs in an area of ~1,200 km² of evergreen and gallery forests on the Lake Tanganyika escarpment (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008, unpubl. data 2019).

Recently, rapidly rising human population densities, accompanied by large-scale forest conversion in the larger, mainland part of the range in Nigeria and Cameroon, are rapidly reducing the area occupied by <em>S. alleni</em> and, therefore, its numbers. The trend in habitat loss is expected to continue into the future, and to accelerate. Therefore, the status of <em>S. alleni</em> is changed from Least Concern to Near Threatened. A population decline of at least 20% is probable in the 12-year period from 2010 to 2022 (approximately equal to three generations, with an estimated generation time of 4 years), nearly meeting criterion A4c.","Found in lowland and montane primary and secondary forest; also recorded in farmbush. A nocturnal species that forages on the ground, and in the low- and mid-canopy.","The major threat to <em>Sciurocheirus alleni</em> is ongoing habitat loss in southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon. The estimated rate of forest loss in Nigeria increased from 2.7% per annum 1990–2000 to 5.0% per annum 2000–2015 (FAO 2015) and is likely to continue to accelerate. Large-scale agricultural projects for crops, such as oil palm in the Southwest Region (Linder 2013), as well as rapid urbanization around the city of Douala, have led to major loss of habitat&#160;in Cameroon, and this loss is projected to continue. Habitat loss is also the primary threat to <em>S. alleni </em>on Bioko. Although occasionally hunted on Bioko (Cronin <em>et al.</em> 2015), hunting does not represent a significant threat to the species.","This species is locally common in appropriate habitat. The highest densities are recorded in montane forest, with lower densities in primary lowland forest (Ambrose and Pimley 2013). Density in secondary forest on Mount Kupé, Cameroon, of about 14 animals/km² (Pimley 2002, Pimley <em>et al.</em> 2005). Encountered at the rate of 1–2 individuals/hr at various elevations on Bioko Island (Ambrose and Pimley 2013); at 0.48 individuals/hr in lowland forest in Korup National Park (Bearder and Honess 1992); and at 0.43 individuals/hr in lowland forest at Rhoko near Cross River National Park in Nigeria (Bearder and Oates 2009).<br/><br/>The species is likely to be declining in many parts of its range due to rapidly growing human population, large-scale forest conversion, shifting agriculture, smallholder farming and small-scale resource extraction.

96192471,18262,Piliocolobus lulindicus,Endangered,A2cd,2020,2020-01-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> is a forest-dependent species targeted for bushmeat because of its large size. Over the past 30 years, there has been an approximately 15% loss in forest cover across its range. In the forest that remains, the species has been highly reduced in abundance or extirpated from over 70% of forest blocks surveyed in the western half of the range, and is likely extirpated from parts of the eastern half of its range, including Kahuzi-Biega National Park, which was a stronghold for this taxon in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Total forest loss across the entire <em>P. lulindicus</em> range was about 8,920 km2 (9.3% of the area) over 17 years (2001–2018; GFW 2019), which is 1.7 generations for this monkey (generation time for this genus is estimated at 10 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The rate of forest cover loss in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is increasing over time: since 2014, it has been ~1% per year. Prior to that, the annual rate of loss was 0.25–0.4% (GFW 2019). Eastern DRC has been badly hit, and unfortunately the range of this monkey features as a new “hotspot” of forest loss (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Projecting backwards three generations (to 1990) goes beyond the last 17 years for which forest loss data are available; however, we know that forest loss was already occurring before 2001. If forest loss in the 1990s was consistent with 0.25-0.4% per year, then we would expect approximately 15% of the overall range to have been lost between 1990 and 2020. In addition, the once intact blocks of forest in the region are increasingly fragmented; in DRC, 4.2% of forests classified as intact were lost between 2000–2013 (Potapov <em>et al</em>. 2017). Given the recent increase in rate of forest loss, even more of its range is expected to be lost and/or fragmented in the future.<br/><br/>Just as concerning as habitat loss, if not more so, are population declines due to hunting. Because red colobus taxa are large-bodied and bring a higher profit per cartridge than smaller species, they are preferentially selected by hunters and tend to be eliminated or at least greatly reduced in abundance before other, smaller monkeys. They live in relatively large groups (Struhsaker 2010, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013), and their behaviour faced with a hunter tends to be to observe rather than flee – which affords very easy, multiple targets for the hunter. Hunting pressure was common across all areas surveyed in the recent past, and is exacerbated with the expansion of artisanal mining and during periods of civil unrest.<br/><br/>Monkeys are eaten in villages and traded commercially for consumption in towns and cities, and the bushmeat trade is a serious threat to red colobus across Africa (Struhsaker 2010). In DRC, there were approximately three times more people in 2019 than in 1990 (mean human population growth 1990–2018 was approximately 3% annually). The ability to pay much higher prices for bushmeat by the ever-increasing proportion of urban dwellers has created a highly lucrative market for commercial hunters, which drives increasing extraction of bushmeat from the regions’ forests. At present, 44% of the human population is DRC lives in towns and cities (World Bank 2019) compared to 27% in 1980, and this upward trend has been the case since 1960 (when it was 22%).<br/><br/>Thus, there is a combination of 15% total habitat loss (1990–2020), plus 4.2% loss of intact forest, plus increasing demand for bushmeat (three times more people in DRC), increased access for hunters, and an increased incentive for hunters to supply bushmeat to towns and cities. <em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> is, therefore, suspected to have undergone a population decline exceeding 50% during the past three generations, and is listed as Endangered under criterion A2cd.<br/><br/>Given the increase in the human population, in access to previously intact forest, uncontrolled hunting and the species’ vulnerability to hunting, the decline will likely continue at a similar, if not faster, rate.","<p>Little is known of this species, but all observations have been in forest habitats – terra firma, lowland moist forests, and along rivers. The animals live in groups. It is assumed, that like other red colobus, they are primarily folivores.<br/></p>","<em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> is directly threatened by habitat loss and hunting, and indirectly by the creation of easy access routes into huge areas of previously remote forests and increasing human populations.<br/><br/>The species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush,” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. (2016) and Harris <em>et al</em>. (2017). In DRC, over 90% of forest loss is due to shifting agriculture (Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. 2018). The ongoing trend is gradually increasing annual forest loss since 2001, especially since 2013-2014 (GFW 2020).<br/><br/>Hunting for bushmeat is increasing throughout the range of this taxon. The meat is eaten by rural populations, traded to miners (Spira <em>et al</em>. 2017), or traded markets in urban locations. Road access into once-remote forests – even close to protected areas – has hugely increased during the two decades (Kleinschroth <em>et al</em>. 2019), facilitating increased hunting and transport of bushmeat for commercial trade in both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2016; Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Human populations in the range of this species are growing at roughly 2.7% annually, and this rate will not slow down in the near future (United Nations 2019, World Bank 2019).","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>The population has declined due to uncontrolled hunting, and habitat loss and degradation. Conflict was a major correlate of <em>P. lulindicus </em>decline in the lowland sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP). Kahuzi-Biega National Park is the only protected area where the species has been reported (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2002). In 1994–1995, red colobus were reported as widespread, and common in three of five zones surveyed (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the subsequent eight years, the region was a theatre of intense conflict, during which the park was targeted by hunters and artisanal miners; some areas were burned (Hart <em>et al</em>. 1998). Surveys resumed in 2004 and were conducted periodically through 2017 (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2007, Spira <em>et al</em>. 2018). Red colobus have been not recorded during any post-conflict surveys, including the areas where they were classified as abundant in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Hunting was also a primary factor linked to declines in western populations of this taxon. A rapid assessment survey in 2018 (Hart unpubl. data 2018) found that red colobus were confirmed or highly likely to have been extirpated in 76% of 102 habitat blocks in a zone covering about 45% of the western part of the species’ range, from the Lualaba River to approximately 27° E. The majority of disappearances were reported to have occurred during the period 1998–2006, coinciding with civil unrest and political instability. Uncontrolled hunting was cited in most cases where causality was identified, although habitat loss through the expansion of shifting agriculture affected about 20% of blocks assessed. Habitat loss was very high around important mining centres, such as Kalima, Pangi, Punia and Lubutu, where human population growth was also high.<br/><br/>Populations in the east of the range face higher pressure from the expansion of artisanal mining than populations in the west. Large mining centres are associated with the largest declines of red colobus (Hart unpubl. data 2018). At present, the remaining populations of <em>P. lulindicus </em>occur in isolated subpopulations, separated by areas of degraded or converted habitat, or by areas of suitable forest where the species has been extirpated.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"Endemic to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), <em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> ranges from the Congo (Lualaba) River in the west, east to the lowland-montane transition (1,200–1,500 m asl) at approximately 28.5° E, where it intergrades with <em>P. foai </em>(Rahm 1965, Colyn 1991). The southern limit of the range is mapped as the Lukuga River at approximately 4.7° S (Colyn 1991), where the species apparently occurs in several large forest islands south of the contiguous forest zone.

102331567,15932,Pan paniscus,Endangered,A4bcd,2016,2016-03-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to high levels of illegal hunting, and habitat destruction and degradation, <em>Pan paniscus</em> is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in the last 15–20 years and it is thought that this reduction will continue for the next 60 years. Currently, by far the greatest threat to the Bonobo's survival is poaching for the commercial bushmeat trade. It has been estimated that nine tons of bushmeat are extracted daily from a 50,000-km² conservation landscape within the Bonobo’s range. Not only is there is a massive demand for bushmeat stemming from the cities, but rebel factions and poorly-paid government soldiers add to that demand, at the same time facilitating the flow of guns and ammunition (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). In some areas, local taboos against eating Bonobo meat still exist, but in others, these traditions are disintegrating due to changing cultural values and population movements. Stricter enforcement of wildlife laws and more effective management are urgently needed.<br/><br/>Habitat loss through deforestation and fragmentation ranks second. Much of the forest loss in this region is caused by slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture, which is most intense where human densities are high or growing. Logging and mining do not yet occur on an industrial scale in the Bonobo’s range, but in future, industrial agriculture is very likely to become a serious threat. Minimising the conversion of intact forest to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the future survival of Bonobos. Countrywide factors contributing to the decline include the mobility of growing human populations, opening markets, commercial exploitation of natural resources and road construction. As in the past, the survival of Bonobos will be determined by the levels of poaching and forest loss—threats that have been shown to accompany rapid growth in human populations and political instability (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2014). Due to their slow life history and a generation time estimated to be 25 years, Bonobo populations cannot withstand high levels of offtake. The population decline over a three-generation (75 year) period from 2003 to 2078 is likely to exceed 50%, hence qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A.<br/><p></p>","The geographic range of <em>Pan paniscus</em> is characterised by undulating terrain with elevations between 300 and 700 m asl and a humid climate (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bonobos inhabit closed, moist, mixed, mature and secondary forests as well as forest-savannah mosaics (<em>ibid</em>.). In the eastern and southern parts of their range, Bonobos occupy a mosaic of moist tropical forest, dry forest, savannah woodland, marshy grassland and swamp forest, yet they also require access to relatively-undisturbed mature forests. If available, Bonobos prefer primary forests and seasonally-inundated swamp forests, foraging in small streams and breast-deep ponds (Narat 2014, Serckx 2014).<br/><br/>Bonobos are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. They live in multimale-multifemale, fission-fusion communities, usually made up of 30–80 individuals. A single community occupies a home range of 20–60 km², and there is extensive overlap between the ranges of different communities (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bonobos are omnivorous; over 50% of their diet is comprised of fruits and seeds, which are supplemented with leaves, stems, shoots, pith, bark, flowers, truffles, fungus, and honey (Hohmann <em>et al</em>. 2006). They appear to be more dependent on terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, including aquatic plants, than chimpanzees. Bonobos have occasionally been documented hunting and eating vertebrates (e.g., duikers, primates; Hohmann and Fruth 2008) and invertebrates (e.g., termites, caterpillars; Kano 1992). Bonobos build new nests to sleep in each night and sometimes make day nests in trees at heights of 5–50 m (Fruth 1995). It has been reported that Bonobos also make ground nests (Kano 1983, Guislain and Reinartz pers. comm). Their role as seed dispersers is critical for forest regeneration (Tsuji <em>et al</em>. 2010, Beaune <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>There is no birth season. Gestation is about eight months. Interbirth interval at Wamba (1976–1996) averages 4.8 years, and females average 0.18 offspring per year of their adult life. Physical maturation is slow with infants being weaned shortly before birth of the next offspring. Infant and juvenile mortality is low, with 73% of offspring surviving to age six (Furuichi <em>et al</em>. 1998). Females migrate aged 6–13 years, settling into a new community when they start cycling at 9–12 years. They produce their first offspring at 13–14 years of age (Furuichi <em>et al</em>. 2012). One generation is estimated to be 23–25 years (Myers Thompson 1997, T. Furuichi pers. comm. 2007, Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><p></p>","<p>The major threats to Bonobos include: poaching (mainly for bushmeat and for some medicinal purposes); residue from civil warfare (availability of modern weaponry and ammunition; military-sanctioned hunting); human-induced habitat alteration (commercial logging and agriculture, traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, fallow land); human population growth and migration; and lack of education (insufficient awareness among urban and rural communities that hunting and eating Bonobos is unlawful). Bonobos reproduce slowly, and thus their populations are particularly susceptible to direct losses caused by humans.&#160;</p><p></p><ol><li><strong>Poaching</strong>: despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, poaching is the most direct and immediate threat to great apes in DRC. Although taboos against hunting Bonobos still exist in some regions, these taboos have become ineffective where poachers are not local. In other locations, transient and immigrant human populations with different cultural values have increased the frequency of hunting and eating of Bonobos. Poachers prefer large mammals, and since&#160;Bonobos are the largest primate in the region, they may be targeted along with ungulates and monkeys. Commercial poachers, aided by military and local administrations, are active even in legally-protected sites, such as Salonga National Park (SNP), Lomako-Yokokala Faunal Reserve, Tumba-Lediima Natural Reserve, Sankuru Natural Reserve, and the proposed Lomami National Park. The importance of these protected areas as significant reservoirs of Bonobos will be compromised rapidly if current levels of poaching continue. Between 2003 and 2006, Hart <em>et al</em>. (2008) recorded evidence of poaching in 51% of survey grids across SNP, with hunting pressure highest in the north and east. However, since then, investment in effective antipoaching measures appears to have protected at least the Lokofa Sector in the southern block of SNP, where Bonobo abundance remained stable between 2006 and 2015 (WCS 2015). Extrapolating from interview data gathered for a bushmeat survey conducted in the Lomami National Park (LNP) area in 2008, it was estimated that 270 Bonobos per year were consumed around Kindu, representing three Bonobos per 100 km² per year in the area investigated (Mirambo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Currently, this negative trend has been halted within the park through surveillance and collaboration with local communities (Hart and Hart 2011, 2015). The intake rate of orphaned Bonobos into the Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary may be viewed as another indicator of hunting pressure and/or anti-trafficking efforts. Hughes <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that 4.2 Chimpanzees (2.6–8.9 individuals) are removed from the wild whenever a single live infant is obtained as a by-product of a hunt. Considering that Bonobos are more social than Chimpanzees, the ratio of dead&#160;Bonobos per orphaned infant may be higher. Data compiled between 1994 and 2012 show a small but steady increase in the number of orphans entering the sanctuary, with two peaks each of six infants in 1997 and 2000 during the Congolese wars, and a peak of 16 individuals in 2004 after the implementation of peace and return to the regular use of rivers as major transport routes (ABC 2012). An influx of nine Bonobos in 2012 was also notably high, but arrivals decreased to two in 2015. While various explanations for lower intakes are possible (e.g., decline of Bonobos in the wild, or effective anti-poaching and anti-trafficking measures, or Bonobos being exported illegally), it is important to remember that the variation in such small numbers may be stochastic, rather than a real trend.</li><li><strong>Habitat loss</strong>: subsistence agriculture, commercial agriculture, logging and road construction all cause forest loss and fragmentation that reduces the usable (or ‘effective’) habitat available to&#160;Bonobos. Moreover, civil strife has been shown to exacerbate destruction and degradation of&#160;Bonobo&#160;habitat: in Luo Scientific Reserve and Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve, primary forest loss in previously unfragmented core forests was over two times greater during a decade when conflict and war were predominant in the region (1990–2000) than during a relatively conflict-free period (2000–2010), when humans left their hiding in core forest areas and returned to their natal villages and farms within long-established agricultural complexes (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, as conflict recedes, large-scale commerce is expanding and industrial agriculture is likely to become a significant driver of forest loss. Oil palm is already being grown in what would otherwise be&#160;Bonobo&#160;habitat (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2012), and Africa is becoming the new frontier for oil-palm plantations, which offers excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperature conditions (Rival and Levang 2014). A staggering 99.2% of the Bonobo’s range is suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014), highlighting the enormous risk the palm-oil industry will pose unless sustainable management plans are developed and implemented to protect great apes and their habitats (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014). It is worth noting that even though permits for prospection or resource extraction have already been granted, drilling for petroleum is unlikely to recommence in the near future, given the low price of crude oil on the international market. Although logging and mining do not yet occur on a large scale in Bonobo habitat, industrial extraction could become a serious threat in future. Minimising the conversion of intact forest in DRC to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the survival of Bonobos, particularly when considering DRC’s high human population growth rate (2.45% in 2015; CIA 2015).</li><li><strong>Disease</strong>: infectious diseases are of particular concern in areas where Bonobos live in close proximity to human communities, or have been habituated to human observers for research or tourism purposes (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015). Diseases that pose a risk to Bonobos include human-borne pathogens such as respiratory viruses, and natural pathogens such as <em>Ebolavirus</em>. Respiratory disease outbreaks were observed among Bonobos at Wamba when displaced people and soldiers were moving through the forest (Sakamaki<em> et al</em>. 2009), and human respiratory syncytial virus and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> co-infection has been detected at Malebo, where Bonobo habitat is surrounded by a particularly high human density (Leendertz pers. comm.). In 2014, a human outbreak of Ebola virus disease occurred in the Bonobo’s range. Considering their highly cohesive social structure, and high rates of physical contact, an <em>Ebolavirus</em> outbreak could devastate a Bonobo community. Despite a lack of scientific investigation of disease in wild Bonobos, these cases highlight the increasing need for health monitoring and disease contingency plans, as recommended by Gilardi <em>et al</em>. (2015).</li></ol><p></p><p></p>","The size of the Bonobo population is uncertain because only 30% of its historic range has been surveyed. Estimates from the four known Bonobo strongholds, based around protected areas, suggest a minimum population of 15,000–20,000 individuals (IUCN and ICCN 2012, IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). Although Hickey <em>et al</em>. (2013) compiled and analysed all Bonobo survey data collected between 2003 and 2010, the survey coverage was too patchy to allow the total number of Bonobos to be estimated.<br/><br/>Sop <em>et al</em>. (in prep.) used spatial modelling to investigate trends in Bonobo nest encounter rates on recce and standard line transect surveys carried out in two different periods. Data were available from eight sites, covering a total area of 16,500 km². Site-specific change estimates were weighted according to population size, and then change in nest encounter rates between different years was used as a proxy for Bonobo population change. Rate of change was estimated using two approaches: site-level Generalized Linear Models (GLMs); and a simple exponential population change model (ExpM). Sop <em>et al</em>. estimated an annual decline of 5.95% with a total decline of 54.9% between 2003 and 2015 (95% confidence interval: -17.6% to +6.4% and -18% to +0.001% for the GLM and ExpM, respectively). Under the same conditions, the expected decline in abundance over one, two and three generations (25, 50 and 75 years respectively) would be 85.6%, 97.9% and 99.7%, respectively. However, not all sites experienced significant declines in Bonobo abundance. The Lokofa Sector of Salonga National Park, for example, has ecoguards deployed throughout and was the best protected of the eight sites in the analysis (WCS 2015). Although Sop <em>et al</em>.’s assessment incorporated data from both protected and non-protected areas, the total coverage was limited by data availability. In addition, the preliminary model had limitations with regard to the representativeness of sites and data availability, such as disproportionate sampling effort between years; and lack of data on seasonality, nest production, re-use and decay rates. If few nests are located and sample size is low, then precision tends to be poor, leading to weak detection of trends. Although a drop in abundance between the two time periods was detected, the small number of paired samples did not produce population sizes. The range-wide data required will eventually show areas considered to be suitable, but from which Bonobos are absent, and perhaps presence of Bonobos in areas not yet surveyed. Despite uncertainty around the modelled rate of decline, a strong negative trend is apparent in Sop <em>et al</em>.’s analysis. Even with an annual rate of decline of only 1%, total losses would exceed 50% over three generations, underscoring the need for monitoring of Bonobo populations and threats.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pan paniscus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> has a discontinuous range in the low-lying central basin of Equatorial Africa, south of the Congo River.

The potential geographic range is approximately 563,330 km²; however, only 28% (156,211 km²) of this area is suitable for Bonobos (Hickey<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Four geographically-distinct Bonobo strongholds have been identified (IUCN and ICCN 2012):</span></p><ul><li>The ‘northern block’ (Maringa-Lopori-Wamba) <span lang=""EN-US"">includes the Luo Scientific Reserve, the Lomako-Yokokala Faunal Reserve, and the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve with community-level protection;</li><li>The ‘eastern block’ (Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba)&#160;includes&#160;the Sankuru Natural Reserve;</li><li>The ‘southern block’ (Salonga) – the 36,000-km² Salonga National Park (SNP) was the first protected area created that harbours bonobos;</li><li>The ‘western block’ (Lac Tumba-Lac Mai Ndombe) <span lang=""EN-US"">includes<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;the Tumba-Lediima Natural Reserve.</span></li></ul><p></p><p>               Additional surveys are needed to better determine the species’ overall distribution and abundance. </p><p></p>",<p>Killing or capture of Bonobos for any purpose is against national and international laws.</p>,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Pan paniscus</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES and as Class A under the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Bonobos are protected by national and international laws throughout their range, and the majority are found in national parks (IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). However, most protected areas lack resources and suffer from poorly-controlled poaching, and enforcement is generally weak.</p><p>An IUCN and ICCN (2012) Bonobo conservation strategy (<a href=""http://www.primate-sg.org/bonobo"">http://www.primate-sg.org/bonobo</a>)&#160;outlines five intervention strategies with objectives and conservation actions centred on the Bonobo&#160;‘strongholds’,&#160;which are to be implemented by 2022:</p><p></p><ol><li><strong>Strengthening institutional capacity.&#160;</strong>One objective under this strategy is the creation of new protected areas. Since SNP was established in 1970, an additional 35,580 km² supporting Bonobos has been officially designated. The Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve in the ‘northern block’ was created in 2012 (Sakamaki <em>et al.</em> 2012). The establishment of LNP, currently a provincial park with a ban on all hunting, will add 8,880 km² of protected habitat to the Bonobo’s range (Doumenge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Once LNP is officially gazetted, protected areas harbouring Bonobo populations will total more than 78,080 km². Protected areas, however, will not curtail poaching as long as law enforcement is ineffective, thus the objectives of eliminating poaching, monitoring and controlling the bushmeat trade, and eliminating the circulation of weapons and ammunition in protected areas are crucial. Considerable efforts have been made in SNP, with recent improvements in guard numbers, education and equipment. The government’s ‘Operation Bonobo’ aims to confiscate military weapons that have been in circulation since 2012, carry out joint FARDC and ICCN patrols, and liberate the parts of SNP under the control of poachers. A specially-trained ‘<em>Corps en charge de la sécurisation des Parcs Nationaux</em>’ will be in charge of anti-poaching in all national parks. However, law enforcement in the Bonobo’s range as a whole is still fragmentary, and conservation efforts are hampered by the vastness of the areas to be patrolled, as well as corruption and isolation, and persistent political and economic instability. NGOs and research projects with bilateral investment provide greater assurance of active and permanent on-the-ground enforcement, and are working to strengthen ICCN’s limited capacity throughout DRC.</li><li><strong>Consultation and collaboration with local actors.&#160;</strong>Here the main objective is to integrate conservation issues into national development plans, land-use and macro-zoning plans, and implement sustainable subsistence activities at key sites. In an attempt to transfer responsibility for&#160;managing natural&#160;resources to local communities, WWF began sensibilisation activities in the Lac Tumba and Salonga-Lukenie-Sankuru landscapes and around southern block of SNP, and assisted stakeholders to establish local development and conservation committees (<em>Comités locaux de développement et de conservation</em>).&#160;</li><li><strong>Awareness building and lobbying.&#160;</strong>Objectives include developing a nationwide communications strategy, undertaking awareness-building activities at key sites, sensitising urban communities and private sector operators, and lobbying government administration at national and provincial levels. In 1995, USAID established the 25-year Central Africa Regional Programme for the Environment (CARPE) to increase local, national and regional capacity and participation in natural resource management, and strengthen conservation policy development and implementation to reduce biodiversity loss. Recently, CARPE established two distinct but interdependent projects:&#160;an Environmental Monitoring and Policy Support (EMAPS) project intended to boost the quality and scope of conservation policy-making, and forest monitoring, analysis and information dissemination; and CAFEC (see below; USAID 2014). Smaller organisations are conducting conservation education programmes in areas adjacent to Bonobo habitat as well as urban centres, such as Kinshasa or Kisangani, where demand for bushmeat is high. For example, Lola ya Bonobo in Kinshasa welcomes more than 20,000 visitors per annum, half of them school children. Such education-outreach activities can influence local attitudes to wildlife (ABC 2014).</li><li><strong>Research and monitoring activities.&#160;</strong>The primary objective here is to develop a clear framework for monitoring Bonobo populations and the threats to Bonobos, which is necessary to track changes in population size and distribution, to assess the level and location of threats, and ultimately to assess progress towards the Goal and Vision of the 2012 conservation strategy. The Central Africa Forest Ecosystems Conservation (CAFEC) project, and the SCAEMPS programme (Strengthening Central Africa Environmental Management and Policy Support) were established under CARPE. CAFEC supports the sustainable management of targeted forest landscapes, which include most of the landscapes where Bonobos occur, and involves targeted, site-based activities. SCAEMPS is a regional ‘quality control’ programme, ensuring that standardised, state of the art methods of monitoring wildlife, law enforcement (such as SMART&#160;<a href=""http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org/"">http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org</a>), and livelihoods and governance are used across CARPE landscapes, and that databases are established to store the data collected. Supported by CARPE and other donors, ICCN and international NGOs have implemented surveys in about 40% of SNP. A three-year co-management agreement for the future monitoring and management of SNP was signed in 2015, focusing on the education, training and support of guards. Development of cost-efficient methods for biomonitoring (camera traps, drones) is underway. Development of a disease prevention plan to minimise human-Bonobo disease transmission, and establish an early detection mechanism and an emergency intervention plan to address potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks is not yet underway.</li><li><strong>Sustainable funding.&#160;</strong>Here, the objective is to evaluate funding needs for Bonobo conservation and create sustainable sources of funding. In the last 10 years,&#160;government donors (EU, KfW, USAID) have provided considerable conservation finance to support biodiversity conservation, park management, education or other developmental aid, rather than species-specific activities.&#160;While Bonobos will benefit from general support, a number of smaller donors (Arcus Foundation, Beneficia Foundation, USFWS, zoological gardens) are sponsoring the smaller NGOs and distinct projects focused on Bonobo conservation. Monetary support has slowly increased over time; however, the extent to which Bonobo populations outside protected areas is benefitting needs to be assessed. Fortunately, the Bonobo population does not need to be reinforced with individuals bred in captivity. In 2009 and 2011, Lola ya Bonobo, where intake rates and breeding have led to spatial constraints, released rehabilitated Bonobos back into the wild. The released individuals adapted easily to their new environment, became fully independent and reproduced successfully. Despite this success and the repopulation of a small area of former Bonobo habitat, reintroduction of great apes is controversial and often viewed as a mechanism for managing sanctuary populations (ABC 2014, C. André pers. comm.). Even more contentious are the potential ramifications for resident wild Bonobos, despite careful planning and selection of the site, and diligent preparation of the individual Bonobos released following IUCN guidelines for the reintroduction of great apes (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2007).</li></ol><p></p><p>In sum, for protection of Bonobos to be effective, commercial poaching must be halted, intensification rather than expansion of local agriculture&#160;must be supported, and local industries must be actively persuaded to support rather than subvert conservation objectives.

Spotted often in tangles of brush or lianas, it appears to forage in these areas at lower levels of the forest. It is nocturnal and has been observed in pairs (presumably male/female), with offspring, and singly. Groups of two to six nest in holes of larger trees and prefer to complement the nest with straw, even covering themselves with it in captivity (Meier and Albignac 1991).

The species has also been noted to occur in cultivated areas, which are considered marginal, unsuitable, habitats. However, these plantations can support multiple individuals if there is adjacent endemic forest as well (Randimbiharinirina <em>et al. </em>2017). The southern spiny desert appears to be the only habitat in which the species does not occur. Its presence in many areas appears to be determined largely by its primary food resource, the seeds of ramy (<em>Canarium </em>spp.) although there are also other dietary staples (Randimbiharinirina <em>et al.</em> 2017). During the day, <em>D. madagascariensis</em> sleeps in nests, tree forks or vine tangles. Nests may be occupied for a few days at a time and several individuals may use the same nest at different times (usually a female with a dependent offspring). &#160;</p><p>                    <em>Daubentonia madagascariensi</em><em>s </em>has vast home ranges which exceed 600 ha; interestingly, individuals appear to spend more time moving along the ground than any other lemur except <em>Lemur catta</em> (Sterling 1993). Recent evidence suggests that Aye-ayes are not strictly solitary, but also forage in tandem and may exhibit differing relationships between animals of the same sex (Sterling and Richard 1995). Aye-ayes appear to have no restricted mating season (i.e. non-seasonal). A single offspring is born which is nurtured for 18 – 24 months before it is weaned. Females begin breeding at three or four years, and indications are that females give birth every two to three years (Petter and Peyrieras 1970, E. E. Louis, Jr. <em>pers. comm.</em>).</p>","Habitat destruction is the primary threat for aye-aye throughout their range, with trees such as <em>Intsia bijuga</em> and <em>Canarium madagascariensis</em> – dietary staples for the species – being cut preferentially for the construction of boats, houses, and coffins (Iwano and Iwakawa 1988). As this species subsist primarily as signal individuals with enormous home territories, loss of habitat is primary threat. These animals are killed in some areas as a harbinger of evil/symbol of bad luck and as a crop-pest (e.g. coconuts), as well as hunted for food (only known from certain parts of Makira (C.

The animals tend to rely heavily on 10–20% of the nearly 100 plant species it exploits, and feeds more on flowers during the dry season than at other times of the year. This species is known to raid farms and plantations. Females have a 34 day reproductive cycle, with the vulva being closed when not in oestrus. In Ankarana<strong> </strong>and Montagne d' Ambre, mating occurs in late May and early June, and births take place from mid-September through October. The gestation period is 125 days (Kappeler 1987). One or two young are born, each weighing approximately 60 grams. Weaning occurs at 6–7 months.

There might be a larger population of the species in Comoros than there is in Madagascar. On Madagascar, it is known from the region of Ambato-Boéni, including the Anaboazo, Ambahivahy, Mangidirano, Ankirihitra and Mariarano forests, and Ankarafantsika; the northern limit of its distribution appears to be near Analalava on the Bay of Narindra, and it has been seen south and west of the Betsiboka River at Katsepy and on the shores of Lac Kinkony, on both sides of the Mahavavy River and in the Tsiombikibo forest near Mitsinjo (Mittermeier <em>et al. </em>2010). It ranges from sea level to 400 m. It is sympatric with <em>E. fulvus </em>north of the Betsiboka River, and with <em>E. rufus </em>south of it.

The highest densities of the species are found in the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetland Complex where high rates of deforestation are causing fragmentation within the already very small fragments. The species does not appear to move between fragments and seems limited to only the largest of the remaining forest patches (Shrum 2008). Attention is quickly needed toward the enforcement of the remaining large fragments within the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetland Complex, as well as the forests surrounding Ambato-Boeny, as the last of the viable habitat for the species is quickly being further fragmented. </p>  As of 2019, there were 110 Mongoose Lemurs in zoological collections worldwide (ZIMS 2019).

Initial searches of other remaining forests in the Farafangana region do not appear to harbour this species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2008). Unfortunately, Manombo and Agnalazaha represent less than 5% of the total remaining habitat within this species' range (Irwin <em>et al. </em>2005). It also occurs in continuous corridor forests west of Vondrozo, which are now part of COFAV (Johnson and Overdorff 1999). This will be critical for the long-term survival of the Grey-headed Lemur, as the vast majority of populations are found within this corridor and few are presently protected. Enhanced protection of the classified forest adjacent to Manombo Special Reserve is a high conservation priority (in progress with the national NGO GERP), as is preservation of the existing, very interesting hybrid zone at Andringitra National Park and surrounding areas. As of 2009, there were approximately a dozen individuals reported in four zoological collections (ISIS 2009), but only one of these (Linton Zoo, UK) is keeping a breeding group (C.

This lemur is largely frugivorous with minor proportions of flowers, young leaves, and insects in the diet during the year (120 plants species from 45 families, Donati <em>et al</em>. 2007). The most important plant species included in the diet are <em>Syzigium</em> spp., <em>Dypsis</em> spp., and <em>Uapaca</em> spp. Collared Brown Lemurs are cathemeral animals, remaining active both day and night throughout the year and their activity is strongly influenced by nocturnal luminosity and photoperiodic variations (Donati and Borgognini Tarli 2006). In littoral forest fragments ranging areas vary from 21 to 113 hectares depending on habitat type and social groups tend to be multi-male/multi-female with group size from 2 to 17 depending on habitat degradation (Donati <em>et al</em>. 2011; Campera <em>et al</em>. 2014). Groups can include as much as 22 individuals in rainforest areas (T. Nguyen <em>pers. comm.</em>). Females give birth in September/October after a gestation of about 120 days and twins are not rare (G. Donati <em>pers. comm.</em>). Small groups can disperse across semi-open habitat and move between forest fragments, as observed it was observed in Sainte Luce (S. Hyde Roberts and E. Racevska <em>pers. comm.</em>).

Unfortunately the situation facing the species outside of these few recovering subpopulations is suspected to be extremely critical, with many subpopulations likely to have gone extinct in the recent past or to be pushed to extinction in the near future; and even within the recovering subpopulations factors such as climate change, limited genetic diversity and increasing anthropogenic threats are likely to impact the viability of these subpopulations into the future.</p><p></p>","<p>This species is associated with habitats containing large-culmmed bamboo (King <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017), particularly <em>Cathariostachys madagascariensis</em> in mid to high altitude rainforest sites (Tan 1999, 2000; Dolch <em>et al.</em> 2008; Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011; Randrianarimanana <em>et al.</em> 2012; Olson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and <em>Valiha diffusa</em> and <em>Bambusa vulgaris</em> in lowland secondary habitats (Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, Bonaventure <em>et al. </em>2012, Lantovololona <em>et al. </em>2012, Mihaminekena <em>et al.</em> 2012, King <em>et al.</em> 2013a). In Ranomafana National Park, the bamboo <em>Cathariostachys madagascariensis </em>can account for as much as 95% of the diet, with shoots, young and mature leaves, and pith being consumed (Tan 1999, 2000, Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017), a diet containing very high levels of cyanide (Ballhorn <em>et al.</em> 2016). The patchiness of this bamboo species may be one factor limiting the current distribution and population continuity of <em>Prolemur simus</em>, as this key food species is not found in all forest microhabitats, and may be limited to forest near large rivers. The availability of drinking water could also be a limiting factor, as during dry months in Ranomafana National Park, <em>P. simus </em>was the only lemur species seen regularly coming to streams to drink water (Wright <em>et al. </em>2008). The current distribution of the species coincides with regions with the shortest dry seasons, suggesting that prolonged dry seasons may have caused the historical reduction in the species range (Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>Observations of wild populations and animals in captivity suggest that this species is cathemeral, active both during the day and at night throughout the year. They live in polygamous groups that can occupy home ranges of 40-60 ha or more &#160;(Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2010, and references therein). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Unusually for lemurs, males are dominant in <em>P. simus</em> groups (Roullet 2012). Males are slightly heavier than females (mean adult weights 2.75 and 2.61 kg respectively at Kianjavato; Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Terrestriality in <em>P. simus</em> is seasonal, being more frequent in the austral summer than the austral winter, peaking in January in Kianjavato (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in February at Ambalafary (Mihaminekena <em>et al.</em> 2018) and in Ranomafana National Park (Tan 2000 cited by Mihaminekena <em>et al.</em> 2018). Home-range is reported to be larger in the austral summer than the austral winter (Mihaminekena <em>et al.</em> 2018). . </p><p>                        </p><p>Individuals have lived over 24 years in captivity.<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> Median generation time is estimated at 10 years (Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2018 based on observations of <em>P. simus</em> and <em>L. catta</em>). Adult female annual mortality at Kianjavato over a four-year period ranged from 0% to 22% (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), with a mean of 7.75%. <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Reproductive females generally give birth annually to a single infant (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), with twins only rarely reported (Randriahaingo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Minimum fecundity rates for reproductive females at Kianjavato over a three year period ranged from 91.7% to 100%, mean 94.0%, although still-born or infant deaths soon after birth may have been overlooked (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Two females of known age had their first infants in their third year at Kianjavato, and males exhibited dispersal behaviour in their third and fourth years (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). In captivity the youngest female to give birth was just under two years old (1 year 11 months 7 days; Roullet 2012), and the youngest male at conception was 2.7 years old (2 years 8 months 6 days; Roullet 2012). Gestation length at Kianjavato was observed to be 149 days for one female, and 148 to 150 days for another female (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Timing of births is highly seasonal. At Kianjavato, 88% of births were estimated to occur during an eight-week period in September and October, including 47% within a two-week period from mid- to late-September. The average birthdate of infants to multiparous females was the 28 September at Kianjavato, 99 days after the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere of 21 June (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), significantly earlier than the 138 days after the winter solstice reported from the higher-elevation site of Ranomafana National Park (Tan 2000 cited by Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015; most births in October and November). Most successful copulations at Kianjavato were calculated to occur in late April and early May (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), and at Ranomafana in May and June (Mutschler and Tan 2003). Interbirth intervals of wild <em>P. simus</em> at Kianjavato were found to be one year (12.1 months following a surviving infant and 11.5 months if the infant died, although the difference was not statistically significant; Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). The age of weaning during the same study was roughly estimated at 7 months after birth (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), and in captivity at 8.5-10 months (Roullet 2012). Infant mortality in wild <em>P. simus</em> at Kianjavato over a three-year period ranged from 40.0% to 54.5% per year, with a mean of 46.7% (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Infants stay in direct contact with their mothers for the first two weeks of their lives, declining to around 80% of their time by the second month (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015, Mihaminekena <em>et al.</em> in press).</span></p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><p><strong><span lang=""EN-CA""></span></strong>  </p><span lang=""EN-CA""></span>","<p>                  </p><p>The Greater Bamboo Lemur is threatened by slash-and-burn agriculture, illegal logging, mining, the cutting of bamboo, and hunting with slingshots and snares, the latter exacerbated by their movements into rice paddies. Climate change may have been a major driver of the huge historical reduction of range of <em>Prolemur simus</em>, and is predicted to have significant impacts in the future as well, not only through modifying habitats but also by impacting the seasonality of the availability of bamboo shoots due to prolonged dry seasons (Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;A 50% decline in range is estimated between 2000 and 2080 due to climate change alone (Brown and Yoder 2015).

Causes of this reduction (which have not ceased) include observed, inferred and predicted continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat from slash-and-burn agriculture, illegal logging, mining, the cutting of bamboo, and climate change, and decline in the number of mature individuals through unsustainable levels of hunting. In particular, this species is shown to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p><p><em>Prolemur simus</em> was one of the most abundant lemurs in sub-fossil times with a large geographic range and a highest historical population estimated at about one million individuals between approximately 60,000 and 90,000 years ago (Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2018). This was followed by two major population declines, the first due to climatic change, the second probably due to anthropogenic factors (Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2018). By 2007 the known number of <em>P. simus</em> in the wild was less than 100, spread across 11 localities (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2008) within what could be described as five distinct and isolated subpopulations (Torotorofotsy, Ranomafana National Park, Kianjavato, Andringitra National Park, and Karianga-Ivato). Targeted surveys organized from 2008 to 2010 as the first phase of The Aspinall Foundation’s “Saving <em>Prolemur simus</em>” project in collaboration with various partners including Association Mitsinjo, GERP and Conservation International, led to an extension to the known range of the species and the discovery of over twenty previously unknown localities (Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011) in seven subpopulations (Zahamena National Park, western Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor, Andriantantely, Vohiposa, Mahalina, Nosivolo-Marolambo, Midongy-Vondrozo). Around the same time an additional subpopulation was discovered to the east of Ranomafana National Park. However, despite the discovery of these previously unknown subpopulations, numbers of individuals were very low at each site, and in early 2010 the total known number of <em>P. simus</em> in the wild was estimated at between 230 and 320, and in 2011 at about 420. By 2015 the known number of <em>P. simus</em> in the wild had risen to just over 1,000 individuals (Helpsimus 2015), with one subpopulation numbering over 250 individuals (Andriantantely with 281 reported <em>P. simus</em>), another with over 200 individuals (Vohitrarivo-Tsaratanana with 229), three with 100-150 individuals (CAZ west-Torotorofotsy, Vohiposa and Kianjavato), and five others with reported numbers of less than 100. A few additional sites were reported to have possible subpopulations based on indirect evidence. The two largest subpopulations have continued to increase and by 2018 were reported to comprise between 400 and 500 individuals each, and approaching 250 mature individuals in each. </p><p>                      </p><p>Between 2010 and 2018 mean population growth of <em>P. simus</em> groups within the Andriantantely subpopulation benefiting from the initiation of community-based protection was 22% per year (H.N.T. Randriahaingo, M. Ravaloharimanitra, T. King / The Aspinall Foundation, unpublished data). This growth rate appears to be slowing from initially higher rates of 26% to 29% during the first few years, probably due to the protected groups approaching the carrying capacity of the available habitat. Similarly at Kianjavato, following several years of conservation activities (and therefore probably of population growth), growth rates over a 3-year period varied from -1% to 17% at a mean of 7.3% (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>                  </p><p>                    </p><p>Subfossil remains confirm that <em>Prolemur simus </em>once had a widespread distribution in Madagascar that covered the northern, north-western, central and eastern portions of the country, including Ampasambazimba in the Itasy Basin (west of Antananarivo), the Grotte d'Andrafiabe on the Ankarana Massif, and the Grottes d'Anjohibe near Mahajanga and Tsingy de Bemaraha (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2018). By the late 1800s the species' range was restricted to the eastern rainforests, with collecting records from ca. 1870 to 1913 recording it from the Bay of Antongil in the north-east to Nandihizana in the south-east (Godfrey and Vuillaume-Randriamanantena 1986, Schwarz 1931). In the mid-1900s some authors believed that the species may have become extinct (Napier and Napier 1967), until it was rediscovered in the south-east in the 1960s and 70s (Meier and Rumpler 1987, Petter <em>et al.</em> 1977). Until recently these south-eastern populations were thought to be the last remaining of the species (Mutschler and Tan 2003). Recent range extensions based on confirmed sightings illustrate that the present-day range is not as diminished as previously thought (Dolch <em>et al.</em> 2008, King and Chamberlan 2010, Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, King <em>et al.</em> 2013a), and indirect evidence suggests the species may still be widely distributed through much of eastern Madagascar (Dolch <em>et al.</em> 2010, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2013, 2017, King <em>et al. </em>2013a). The latitudinal range of sites with confirmed sightings as of May 2018 is 18°06’S (near Didy in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor; The Aspinall Foundation, unpubl. data) to 22°26’S (near Karianga, north of Vondrozo; Johnson and Wyner 2000, Wright <em>et al.</em> 2008). The elevation range for confirmed sightings is 20 (Bonaventure <em>et al.</em> 2012) to 1,600 m (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2001 in Wright <em>et al. </em>2008). Confirmed sightings have been made in recent years in the remaining mid to high altitude rainforest corridors from Didy to Andasibe (Dolch <em>et al.</em> 2008, Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Randrianarimanana <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014, Olson <em>et al.</em> 2012) and from the Ranomafana National Park to the Andringitra National Park (Petter <em>et al.</em> 1977, Wright <em>et al. </em>2008, Delmore <em>et al.</em> 2009), and in lowland degraded landscapes in the Brickaville District (Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Bonaventure <em>et al.</em> 2012, Lantovololona <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mihaminekena <em>et al</em>. 2012, Randriahaingo <em>et al. </em>2014, Ralison <em>et al.</em> 2015), the Vatomandry District (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2017), at the confluence of the Mangoro and Nosivolo rivers in the Mahanoro District (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, Andrianandrasana <em>et al. </em>2013), in the Ifanadiana District east of Ranomafana National Park (Rakotoarinivo <em>et al.</em> 2017a), around Kianjavato in the Mananjary District (Andriaholinirina <em>et al.</em> 2003, Wright <em>et al. </em>2008, McGuire <em>et al. </em>2009, Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), and near Karianga in the Vondrozo District (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2009).</p><p>This species is likely affected by national trends in forest habitat loss: Madagascar lost 37% of its forest cover from 1973 to 2014, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.1%/year from 2010 to 2014.

This assessment prompted the creation in 2008 of the “Saving <em>Prolemur simus</em>” project, initiated as the first priority of The Aspinall Foundation’s Madagascar Programme in collaboration with various partners in Madagascar to realise five principle objectives: 1) facilitating communication and collaboration; 2) surveying for new sites supporting the species; 3) ensuring effective conservation management of known sites in the remaining forest corridors; 4) ensuring effective conservation management of known sites in isolated habitats outside forest corridors; and 5) when appropriate, ensuring the survival of individuals in sites that can not be protected through translocation or captive breeding (King and Chamberlan 2010). Collaborative community-based surveys undertaken in 2009 and 2010 by The Aspinall Foundation, Association Mitsinjo, GERP Conservation International and others led to the discovery of several previously unknown populations and significant extensions to the known range of the species (King and Chamberlan 2010, Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2013). Building on the ongoing <em>P. simus</em> conservation work initiated in and around Torotorofotsy by Association Mitsinjo (Dolch <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, 2015), community-based conservation activities were immediately initiated at many of the newly discovered sites by The Aspinall Foundation with various partners, especially in the northern (Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor, Andriantantely and surrounding areas; Ravaloharimanitra and King 2012; Chamberlan <em>et al.</em> 2013; King <em>et al.</em> 2013a, 2013b, 2013c; Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2013a, 2013b, 2015) and central (Nosivolo; Andrianandrasana <em>et al.</em> 2013, Rakotonirina and Chamberlan 2014) parts of the known range. Further south, similar site-based <em>P. simus</em> conservation projects were also being developed, including at Kianjavato by the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership and Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo (Manjaribe <em>et al.</em> 2013; Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015), at Vohitrarivo-Tsaratanana by Helpsimus and partners (Rakotoarinivo <em>et al.</em> 2017a, 2017b), and at Ivato-Mahasoa by MICET/ICTE (P. Wright, <em>pers. comm.</em>), in addition to the long-term research and conservation activities in the Ranomafana National Park (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2008, Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017). The combined efforts of these projects led to the recovery of the known population of <em>P. simus</em> from about 100 to over 1,000 individuals in just under a decade. Whilst this is a remarkable collaborative conservation achievement, based primarily on community-based conservation, the situation of the species remains very fragile and dependent on the continued commitment of this small number of organisations to its survival; indeed over half the known population is protected by community-based projects facilitated by just one organisation (The Aspinall Foundation), roughly a third by one other (Helpsimus), and the rest by a small number of organisations including MBP/Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo, Association Mitsinjo, Conservation International, MICET/ICTE and Madagascar National Parks. Apart from the known groups protected and monitored by these projects, populations or groups elsewhere are likely to be continuing to decline due to habitat loss (Morelli <em>et al.</em> 2019) and hunting, and even where they are protected the effects of climate change are predicted to have negative implications for the suitability of the habitats they currently occur in (Eronen <em>et al.</em> 2017). &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>  <p><em>Prolemur simus</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES.

Local people employ a variety of hunting and trapping methods. Direct pursuit by dogs is the most common, but they may also be captured by using a harpoon, a snare, a stick to knock them out or into the water, or by burning their reed bed habitat, causing them to flee into the hands of waiting hunters.

Songs may travel as far as 2 km (Powzyk and Thalmann 2003). The species is considered to be the most diurnal lemur (Powzyk and Thalmann 2003). Indri social groups comprise a monogamous reproductive pair (with monogamy shown to be the norm through genetic paternity testing in several groups; Bonadonna<em> et al. </em>2019) plus up to four other individuals, usually offspring. Changes in group composition can be quite frequent (V. Sorrentino in Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010), and changes in partners can occur although usually only after a mate dies (Powzyk and Thalmann 2003). Groups in fragmented habitat tend to be larger than those in more extensive, undisturbed areas (Pollock 1979, Powzyk 1997). Females give birth every two to three years (Powzyk and Thalmann 2003). Reproduction is highly seasonal, with the birth of a single offspring occurring in May or June. Reproductive maturity is reached between seven and nine years of age (Pollock 1977). Both males and females disperse and the sex ratio at birth is approximately 1:1 (Kappeler 1997).</p>  <p>The diet consists primarily of immature leaves supplemented by flowers, fruit, seeds and bark, which vary in proportion according to season (Powzyk 1997, Powzyk and Thalmann 2003). They occasionally descend to the ground to eat earth, perhaps to detoxify seeds that have also been consumed (Powzyk 1997, Britt <span class=""Betont""><em>et al.</em> 2002, Powzyk and Thalmann 2003). </p>  <p>Indris range evenly within exclusive territories with little or no spatial overlap between territories of neighbouring groups (Bonadonna<em> et al. </em>2017). Mean territory size in fragmented mid-altitude rainforests has been calculated as 13.10 (±5.31) ha, ranging from 5.05-25.91 ha (Bonadonna <em>et al. </em>2017), and in the more pristine forests of Mantadia as up to 40 ha (Powzyk 1997, Powzyk and Thalmann 2003). In the lowland rainforest of Betampona mean home range size has been estimated as 27 ha (Glessner and Britt 2005). Indris are capable of traversing their entire territories in a few minutes but are usually fairly sedentary, moving only a few times during the day (Bonadonna <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Intergroup encounters are rare (Bonadonna <em>et al.</em> 2017). Most (87%) encounters are resolved by territorial songs, only rarely do the disputes result in physical fights between the males (Bonadonna <em>et al.</em> 2017). Encounters occur at the periphery of group territories, between 0 and 82 m from the boundary (mean 22 ± 27 m, Bonadonna <em>et al. </em>2017).</p><p></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-CA""></p><p>                 </p><p>The principal threat to this species is habitat destruction for slash and burn agriculture, logging and fuelwood gathering, all of which take place even within protected areas. Increasing levels of illegal hunting is also a major problem for the Indri (Jenkins <span class=""Betont""><em>et al. </em>2011). Habitat fragmentation is leading to genetic isolation of some Indri populations (Nunziata <em>et al. </em>2016).</span></p><p></p>","<p>Overall population size is unknown, although a figure of 1,000-10,000 has been quoted as a “reasonable estimate” (Andriaholinirina <em>et al.</em> 2014). Population size is decreasing due to habitat destruction and hunting. It is suspected that the rate of decline has surpassed 80% and that this rate of decline will continue over three generations (33 years) into the future due to a combination of habitat loss/degradation, climate change, and the wildlife trade. This species is shown to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>  <p>Madagascar has lost 37% of its natural forest cover over the period 1973–2014 (Vieilledent e<em>t al.</em> 2018), with deforestation rates in moist forests of Madagascar increasing to 1.2% per year from 2010 to 2014 (Vieilledent <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Projected rates are also alarming. Morelli <em>et al</em>. (2020) modelled several scenarios of climate change effects and deforestation and found that rainforests across Madagascar could be reduced by up to 93% by 2070 (14–75% reduction due to climate change alone, 29–59% due to deforestation alone, or 38–93% from a combination of both). For the specific range of the Indri, Brown and Yoder (2015) estimated that the species range will decrease 39.5% from 2000 to 2080 due to climate change alone, without taking deforestation into consideration.</p>  <p>In most sites, population densities are low, with site-specific density estimates ranging from 5.2 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in relatively pristine forest in Mantadia (Powzyk 1997 in Powzyk and Thalmann 2003), 6.9–13.2 individuals/km² in Betampona (Glessner and Britt 2005), 27.7 (± 4.0) individuals per km² in Maromizaha, 26.7 (± 10.5) individuals per km² in Analamazaotra Special Reserve, and 24.2 (± 12.2) individuals per km² in Analamazaotra Forest Station (Bonadonna <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Elsewhere, Indri can be quite abundant in some forests, for example the species is the most frequently observed diurnal lemur in the Andriantantely lowland rainforest (Seaman <em>et al.</em> 2018). It also appears to be edge-tolerant, although this might lead to a higher likelihood of suffering from increasing anthropogenic activities at the edges of forest fragments (Seaman <em>et al. </em>2018). Indeed a subsequent study in the mid-elevation Ankeniheny-Zahamena rainforest corridor suggested that Indri here were edge-intolerant (B. Thompson/University of Kent/The Aspinall Foundation, unpubl. data); this is an area where the traditional taboos against hunting of Indri have been eroding in recent years (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011) and might be an indication of the rapidly increasing level of threat to the species.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This highly distinctive lemur is endemic to the island of Madagascar where it inhabits the eastern rainforests from Anjanaharibe-Sud and Antohaka Lava (15 km SE of Andapa) in the north, south to Anosibe An'ala Classified Forest. It has not been found on the Masoala Peninsula or in Marojejy (Mittermeier<em> et al. </em>2010). It usually occurs at low and mid elevations, but ranges up to 1,800 m (Goodman and Ganzhorn 2004). Populations in the north of the range are generally of black colouration, whilst those in the south are generally of black-and-white colouration, with populations in the centre of the range exhibiting both colour forms and clinal forms (Brenneman <em>et al.</em> 2016).<span lang=""EN-US""></p><p>This species is likely affected by national trends in forest habitat loss: Madagascar lost 37% of its forest cover from 1973 to 2014, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.1%/year from 2010 to 2014.

Although long thought to be protected by local <span class=""Betont"">fadys (traditional taboos), these do not appear to be universal and the animals are now hunted even in places where such tribal taboos do exist. In many areas these taboos are breaking down with cultural erosion and immigration, and local people often find ways to circumvent taboos even if they are still in place. For example, a person for whom eating the Indri is forbidden may still hunt the animals for sale to others, while those who may be forbidden to kill Indris can purchase them for food. Recent studies of villages in the Makira Forest indicate that Indri have also been hunted in the past for their skins (which were worn as clothing), that Indri meat is prized and fetches a premium price, and that current levels of Indri hunting are unsustainable (Golden 2005, 2009, Jenkins <span class=""Betont""><em>et al.</em> 2011, R. Dolch <em>pers. obs.</em>). There is evidence that small numbers of live Indris have been traded within Madagascar in recent years, and others may have been smuggled out of Madagascar.</span></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>                   </p><p>This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. It occurs in 18 protected areas (Rylands<em> et al.</em> 2018), including three national parks (Mananara-Nord, Mantadia and Zahamena) one natural park (Makira), two nature reserves (Betampona and Zahamena) and five special reserves (Analamazaotra, Mangerivola, Ambatovaky, Anjanaharibe-Sud, and Marotandrano) (Mittermeier <span class=""Betont""><em>et al.</em> 2010). A significant population, comprising dark and black-and-white individuals, is found in the Andriantantely lowland rainforest, part of the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor protected area but separated from the main corridor by an area of deforested agricultural land (King <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Seaman <em>et al.</em> 2018). Andriantantely is the focus of community-based conservation activities facilitated by The Aspinall Foundation to protect this high-priority lowland rainforest which supports major populations not only of Indri but also of other Critically Endangered species such as Black-and-white Ruffed Lemurs and Greater Bamboo Lemurs (King <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2015a,b). Much of the Ankeniheny-Zahamena rainforest Corridor also benefits from community-based conservation of sites supporting Indri and other lemurs (King <em>et al.</em> 2013b, Rasolofoharivelo <em>et al.</em> 2013, Ravaloharimanitra <em>et al.</em> 2015b), as do the adjacent sites of Analamazaotra Forest Station and Torotorofotsy-Ihofa complex through the activities of Association Mitsinjo (Dolch <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015). The new protected area at Maromizaha also supports a population of Indri, where GERP runs conservation and research projects (eg. Torti <em>et al.</em> 2018, Bonadonna <em>et al.</em> 2019). A major region wide conservation education campaign to eliminate hunting is recommended (eg. Randrianasolo <em>et al</em>. 2013), for which the Indri could be promoted as the flagship species. This species has never successfully been kept in captivity and thus captive breeding programs are highly doubtful.<em></em></p><strong></strong>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

There is a suspected population reduction of ≥50% in this species over a three-generation period (36 years, estimating the generation length to be 12 years). This time period includes some time in both the past and the future. Causes of this reduction (which have not ceased) include continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, severe forest fragmentation, and exploitation through unsustainable levels of hunting and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade.&#160;Based on these premises, the species is listed as Endangered, though it will likely be considered Critically Endangered in the near future.</p><p></p>","<p>The Ring-tailed Lemur’s marked ecological flexibility allows this species to colonize a diverse range of habitats in southern, south-west, and south-central Madagascar including gallery, littoral, and dry deciduous forests, spiny bush, brush and scrub, high-altitude ericoid bush and rocky outcrop vegetation (Sauther <em>et al.</em> 1999, Goodman<em> et al. </em>2006, Gould 2006, Cameron and Gould 2013, Gould and Gabriel 2014, LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2014, LaFleur and Sauther 2015). Indeed, at the upper portion of its elevation range on Andringitra, the species occurs in a zone above the forest line and in a vast expanse of vertical rock, with up to 400-m tall talwegs, surrounded by ericoid savanna. It encounters the most extreme climatic conditions on the island from the hottest and driest (Tsimanampesotse) to the coldest (Andringitra Massif). It has a varied diet, and does not seem to be constrained by available water sources (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2006), although when available does drink water daily (LaFleur, <em>per obs.</em>). Ring-tailed Lemurs are cathemeral and can be active at any time of the day or night, although they seem to avoid night time activity when overnight temperatures are low (Donati <em>et al.</em> 2013, LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2014). This is the best-studied of Madagascar's lemurs; its biology and ecology have been summarized most recently by Jolly <em>et al.</em> (2006), Gould (2006), Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. (2008), Gould <em>et al.</em> (2011), Gould and Gabriel (2014), and Fardi <em>et al.</em> (2018). </p>","<p>Habitat loss, hunting, and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade are the greatest causes of concern. The Ring-tailed Lemur has a strong preference for gallery forests for <em>Euphorbia</em> bush, and rocky outcrop rupicolous forest, but these habitats are already restricted in southern and south-central Madagascar and continue to diminish due to annual burning practices that help create new pasture for livestock. Subsequent over-grazing and harvesting of <em>Euphorbia</em> for livestock, and the felling of trees for charcoal production further impact wild populations. This species is also hunted for food in certain areas and frequently wild-captured and kept as a pet.<br/><br/>Furthermore, due to more frequent droughts in the southern regions compared with past decades, this species is increasingly threatened. Hannah&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008) predicted that a mean temperature increase of 2.6°C will occur in southern Madagascar in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and that arid regions in southern Madagascar will become further desiccated, which will have important and largely negative biological consequences for flora and fauna inhabiting this geographic area. Cyclones, severe storms and flooding also affect this species (see LaFleur and Gould 2009). Moreover, range shift predictions based climatic models for Madagascar suggest that ring-tailed lemurs will experience a net loss of 63% of available habitat simply due to climate change alone (Brown and Yoder 2015). </p>","<p>The population of this species is suspected to be undergoing decline, with individuals are now largely restricted to completely isolated or relatively isolated fragments throughout their geographic range, and overall population densities have been noted as low (Sussman <em>et al</em>. 2003, Gould and Sauther 2016). There is a suspected population reduction of ≥50% in this species over a three-generation period (36 years, estimating the generation length to be 12 years). This time period includes some time in both the past and the future. Causes of this reduction (which have not ceased) include a continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, severe forest fragmentation, and exploitation through unsustainable levels of hunting and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade.</p><p>There are only eight remaining known populations that have more than 100 individual Ring-tailed Lemurs (LaFleur <em>et al</em>. 2018). These are: 1) Amoron’i Onilahy Protected Area, 2) Andringitra National Park, 3) Anja Community Reserve, 4) Berenty Private Reserve (and surrounding forest fragments), 5) Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (Parcels one and two), 6) Isalo National Park, 7) the “Lost Forest” (Ihorombe Region of the Ihosy District), and 8) Tsimanampesotse National Park. Some of these populations are well-protected and unlikely to be extirpated (e.g. Berenty Private Reserve, Anja Community Reserve), or are relatively safe from localized extinction because of the difficult nature of the landscape (i.e. Andringitra National Park). However, other locations are subject to pressure from hunting (i.e. Amoron’I Onilahy), and live-capture for the within country pet trade (i.e. Tsimanampesotse). Fire also presents a risk to Ring-tailed Lemurs (e.g. Isalo, Tsaranoro Valley, and Lost Forest), as does the loss of genetic diversity resulting from population isolation. This species is shown to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p><p><br/>The following lists population counts and/or densities at sites where ring-tailed lemur populations have recently been counted. These sites represent only a fraction of the geographic range, yet give a ‘snapshot’ of the status of some of Ring-tailed Lemur populations in 2018 and illustrate that the overall population of this lemur is low, and that most populations occur in small fragmented forests (see Gould and Sauther 2016, LaFleur <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Berenty Reserve, the population density is 2.5 individuals/ha in the gallery forest, 5.0 individuals/ha at the tourist front, and 1.3 individuals/ha in the scrub and spiny forest (Jolly <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2006, Koyama <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pride 2005, Gould <em>et al.</em> 2011). A total number of 280 individuals in approximately 20 ha have been counted in Berenty Reserve (Razafindramanana 2011, Jolly <em>et al.</em> 2006). In the Bealoka fragment of Berenty Reserve, the population density is 1.67 individuals/ha (Razafindramanana 2011). A total number of 167 individuals in approximately 100 ha have been counted in this fragment (Razafindramanana 2011).<br/><br/>In Cap Ste. Marie, the population density is approximately 0.017 individuals/ha (Kelley 2011). It is not known if this population still exists. At the last confirmed sighting (2018) there were fewer than 50 animals and they were subsisting in extremely degraded habitats and subject to hunting pressure or possibly retaliatory killings (Kelley, <em>pers comm.</em>)<br/><br/>In Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, the population density is 0.10 individuals/ha. Two groups inhabit a 195 ha area of the park (LaFleur 2012). Eleven groups have been counted, though the total number of individuals is unknown (M.

A population density of 1.3 individuals/ha has been recorded in Parcel 1 of the Reserve. In 2001, 104 individuals were counted in a 80 ha area (Parcel 1 of the Reserve) (Gould <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). In 2006, 225 individuals were counted in a 980 ha area (Sauther and Cuozzo 2008).<br/><br/>On the western edge of Andringitra National Park, WWF guides estimated in 2009 that ~100 lemurs may range in a large area of the park, and 12 were counted at the summit of the Diavolana circuit.<br/><br/>A 2013 census at the 34 ha Anja Community Reserve revealed a total of 210 animals and a population density of 6.2 individuals/ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In Tsaranoro forest, the population density in 2013 was 1.47 individuals/ha, with a total of 78 animals in 53 ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In Andranobe community reserve, population density in 2013 was 1.7 individuals/ha. with a total of 30 individuals in 17.4 ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In the 20.3 ha Samisorany community reserve, 21 animals were noted in 2013 with a density of 1.03/ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>The <em>Lemur catta</em> population at the 7.7 ha Sakaviro community reserve, was 30 individuals in 2013 (density= 1.03/ha) (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>Five additional populations of <em>L. catta </em>were counted in small forest fragments in the south-central region (250 sq km area), with populations ranging from 6-28 animals, and densities of 0.28 to 5.3/ha. Two of these fragments were seriously compromised by tree cutting and firewood extraction, and the <em>L. catta</em> populations within were considered at serious risk of extirpation (Gould and Sauther 2016).<br/><br/>In the Ambatotsirongorongo fragment, the population density is 1.5 individuals/ha. In 2010, approximately 50 individuals in a 30 ha area were counted (Razafindramanana 2011).<br/><br/>In the Petriky fragment, the population density is 0.004 individuals/ha. In 2012, four individuals were counted in a 920 ha area (N. Malone <em>pers. comm.</em>), but the population is now likely extirpated (Gould and Sauther 2016).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Ring-tailed Lemur is found in the dry forests, spiny bush, montane forest, mangroves, rocky outcrops, and one rainforest in southern and south-western Madagascar, and in one humid forest in south-eastern Madagascar. The north-western boundary may be Toliara, although this is currently unknown. Populations north of Toliara and west of Isalo may have been locally extirpated, or have at least become extraordinarily rare due to intensive and prolonged bushmeat hunting (see Goodman <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Moniac and Heitmann 2007, Siers 2007, Gardner and Davies 2014). The south-eastern limit ends at the divide between the western and eastern watersheds, which is aligned with the division between western dry and eastern humid vegetation types. All records from the Andohahela National Park are from the extreme western portion, at the ecotone between dry and humid forests. Intensive hunting has taken place here and threatens any remaining individuals or populations of ring-tailed lemurs. The currently known north-eastern limit is Sakaviro Community Reserve, 9 km north-west of the town of Ambalavao. A population also occurs at altitudes up to 2,600 m in the mountains of Andringitra on the south-eastern plateau (Goodman and Langrand 1996, Yoder <em>et al</em>. 1999). A newly discovered population inhabits the humid rainforest, or “Lost Forest”, of the Ihosy District (Ihorombe Region, Wright and Buono, pers comm). A very small population was recorded in the extreme southern region of Cap Sainte Marie in 2007; but it is unknown if this population is currently extant. Throughout the range of this species, its distribution is best described as patchy.</p><p>Range shift predictions based climatic models for Madagascar suggest that ring-tailed lemurs will experience a net loss of 63% of available habitat simply due to climate change alone (Brown and Yoder 2015).</p>","<p>This species is hunted for food (Goodman 2003, Moniac and Heitmann 2007, Siers, 2007, Gardner and Davies 2014) and frequently kept as a pet (LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2019, Reuter <em>et al.</em> 2016). In several regions, such as costal and in-land forests north of Toliara ring-tailed lemurs have likely been hunted to extirpation (see LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2018).

They are also present in plantations and degraded habitats (Ganzhorn and Schmid 1998). Studies at Ampijoroa also indicate that individuals may take shelter in three to nine different tree holes within their range and remain in a given shelter for several days in succession. Females tend to share nests with several conspecifics, while males tend to sleep alone (Radespiel <em>et al.</em> 1998). The sexes also differ in home ranges, as male home ranges tend to be larger, especially during the mating season (Buesching <em>et al</em>. 1998, Radespiel 2000, Eberle and Kappeler 2002).&#160;After a gestation of approximately 60 days, typically two young are born.","In the west of the range, habitat is being lost due to yearly burning for slash-and-burn and cattle grazing. Although <em>Microcebus murinus</em> is reported to inhabit secondary forests  and degraded habitats, there is some evidence that decreased habitat  quality may have adverse effects on population dynamics. According to  Ganzhorn and Schmid (1998), fewer large tree holes in secondary forests  result in fewer opportunities to save energy through periods of torpor,  and may increase levels of stress and mortality.

Forest loss continues not only along fragment edges, but within forest interiors, presumably to evade detection from potential thieves or authorities (especially for vanilla farmers). Recent resource selection analysis (using ranging and dietary data from six Golden-crowned Sifaka groups) suggests that lemurs avoid foraging in parts of their territories that are adjacent to local villages (M. Semel, unpublished data). Mining continues to pose a threat to the species, as the mining footprint continues to grow and excavations become more sophisticated. Furthermore, itinerant miners do not follow local taboos against hunting this species. Construction of a Chinese-backed mining outpost (largely for gold) suggests that this threat will continue to grow. Paving the national road began in 2019 with funds from China.

The diet is seasonally variable but consists mainly of young and mature leaves, fruits and seeds, supplemented with bark, dead wood, and termite soil (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, and references therein), and invertebrates (R.J. Lewis, unpublished data). <em>Propithecus verreauxi</em> tends to live in small to medium, single and multi-male, groups that range from 2-14 (average five to six individuals), with home ranges varying from 4-20 ha depending on habitat. Breeding is seasonal, with mating taking place in January through to early March. Infants are almost completely independent at six months (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, and references therein). The age of first reproduction is typically 5 or 6 years but can occur as early as 3 years. A single offspring is born in June to September after a gestation of 162–170 days (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, and references therein).&#160;</p>","<p>Despite its wide distribution, the two principal habitats upon which this species depends for survival (spiny forest and riparian or gallery forest), are under continual threat because of logging, slash-and-burn agriculture (habitat loss has increased dramatically since 2009 where the loss at Menabe-Antimena was estimated at only 4.1%; however, as of 2017, the loss had increased to 29.7% due to immigration and agricultural shifts to corn followed by peanuts) and charcoal and fuelwood production. The habitat in southern Madagascar has been altered with the introduction of&#160;<em>Opuntia</em>&#160;prickly pear cactus in the 1700s .Fires due to deliberate burning to create savanna for feeding cattle, as well as accidental burning due to the dry nature of the forest are also a major cause of habitat loss in some areas especially the long-term drought in southwestern and western Madagascar. The boat-making industry in the southern Menabe region is a source of substantial selective logging of food and sleep site resources. Although hunting is both illegal as well as <em>fady</em> (taboo) to several of the tribes living within its range (e.g., Antandroy, Mahafaly); it is nevertheless hunted for food by other tribes (e.g., Sakalava) and by immigrants to the region. In the Isalo region, this lemur is known as “<em>sifaka-bilany</em>” (“sifaka of the cooking pot”), but it is unclear whether this is because of its popularity as a food item or because of the sooty black appearance of individuals from this part of the species’ range. Populations are also genetically impoverished in terms of heterozygosity in some areas (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010, and references therein).</p>","<p>Overall population numbers are in decline due to habitat destruction.

In general, densities are lower in areas of degraded habitat which includes protected and nonprotected areas, but even very small forest patches can support sizeable numbers of this species. Reported estimates include 41 individuals/km² in Kirindy Mitea National Park, 150–200/km² at Berenty, and 400–500/km² at Antserananomby.</p><p>Furthermore, although this range including the EOO would be normally considered quite large, the spiny forest habitat in south-western Madagascar has become severely fragmented, decreasing in area by 28% from 1950 to 2000 and undergoing the highest annual rate of deforestation (1.2%) during the 1990’s than any other forest type or region in Madagascar (Harper <em>et al.</em> 2007). This trend has persisted between 2000 to present, continuing the decline in area, extent and quality of habitat. Moreover, the primary threat to <em>Propithecus verreauxi </em>and other regionally endemic biodiversity in the Menabe-Antimena and other regions in western Madagascar is habitat loss to agricultural shift to corn and then peanuts before the land is abandoned. Between 2000 and 2009, deforestation was around 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) per year; by 2014, it was 4,000 hectares per year. By 2017, it is estimated that 29.7 percent was lost. Because 2017 and 2018 were catastrophic with a record number of fires, it is now predicted that the loss could be as high as 44.9 percent in 2020 and 83.1 percent by 2025 (Filou 2019).&#160;</p><p>Furthermore, the habitat in southern Madagascar has been altered with the introduction of <em>Opuntia</em> prickly pear cactus in the 1700s. With its current use as a cheap, quick growing, and readily available option as a living fence, the spiny forest is cleared for cassava and corn which the productivity of the land is short term. Large international mining concessions in southern Madagascar and the subsequent immigration from other ethnic groups into the region have also driven the deterioration of the regional cultural taboos or <em>fady </em>which further threatens this species’ long term survivability.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Verreaux’s Sifaka is distributed in southern, south-western and western Madagascar.

There is also a private reserve, Nahampoana, east of the Andohahela National Park parcels and just north of) Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin) which has a small population of Verreaux’s Sifaka; however, this population was probably introduced there as it is not a part of its historical range.

Group sizes usually range from 2-8 individuals, with mean group sizes reported as 3.6 (n=331) in the north of the species range (Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014), 4.3 (± 1.8, n=16) in the Badrala forest of Antrema (Pichon <em>et al.</em> 2010), 4.2 (± 1.72, n=11) in Ankirihitra (King <em>et al. </em>2012), 4.2 (± 1.83, n=18) from Ambato Boeny south to Andasilaikatsaka (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014) and 3.2 (± 1.48, n=5) in the extreme south-west of the range (King <em>et al.</em> 2014). Group home ranges of 1.2 to 1.5 ha have been reported from Anjamena (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2010), within the Mahavavy-Kinkony protected area, while a population and behavioral study from Mandrava forest demonstrated a group size of 3 to 7 individuals and home ranges from 1.2-2.3 ha with small overlap between groups (Sifaka Conservation 2018). Within groups a social hierarchy is maintained, with females dominant over males (Ramanamisata <em>et al.</em> 2014). Intergroup encounters are often peaceful but sometimes result in aggressive defense of territory (Ramanamisata <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span>","<p>Habitat loss is the principal threat faced by this species (Andriamasimanana and Cameron 2014). Forests within its range have declined dramatically over the last few decades, and continue to be burned to provide pasture for livestock, cut for charcoal production, and logged. There is also a shift from forest to agriculture. Habitat destruction of varying degrees was reported at every single <em>Propithecus coronatus</em> sites surveyed by Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> (2014) and King <em>et al.</em> (2014). Although traditional taboos exist at some sites, hunting for meat occurs at many sites, and was reported at 82% of <em>P. coronatus</em> sites surveyed by Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> (2014) and King <em>et al.</em> (2014). Some live capture for the illegal pet trade has also been recorded (Reuter and Schaefer 2017).</p>","<p>Overall, population figures are in decline due to habitat loss, hunting and other threats. The species is suspected to have undergone a population decline of ≥80% over a period of 30 years (three generations), due primarily to observed continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat from burning of forests to provide pasture for livestock and logging for charcoal production, in addition to exploitation through unsustainable hunting pressure.<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;These causes have not ceased, and will to a large extent not be easily reversible.&#160;This species is shown to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation (Eppley <em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>Forest cover within the geographic range of <em>Propithecus coronatus</em> is very fragmented, and was estimated at between 1,600 and 2,850 km² (King <em>et al.</em> 2014; based on a refined interpretation of the forest cover estimates provided by Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many forest fragments have been completely lost in recent memory, and even in some remaining small fragments <em>P. coronatus</em> has been driven to local extinction (Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014). In sites where they persist, an extensive transect survey in the northern part of the species range found variable densities from 46 to 309 individuals per km² (Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the relatively well-protected and well-studied Badrala forest fragment, within the Antrema new protected area, densities have been estimated at 350 individuals per km² (Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014). Further south, line transects undertaken from 2017 to 2019 at various sites including Mahajeby, Mandrava and Ankirihitra provided estimates from 197 to 287 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Rakotondrabe <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although the total population size extrapolated from field surveys (&gt;100,000 individuals; Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014) and inferred from genetic data (Female <em>N</em>e &gt;10,000; Sgarlata <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) suggests that the species may have had a large population size in the recent past, the recent and ongoing deforestation rates in western Madagascar indicate a much lower current population size. </p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Propithecus coronatus</em> is endemic to western and western-central Madagascar. There have been various confusing and sometimes erroneous descriptions of the precise geographic range of <em>P. coronatus</em> in the past, which have been recently summarized by Thalmann <em>et al.</em> (2002), Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> (2014) and King <em>et al.</em> (2014). Field surveys organized to resolve this confusion were undertaken in 2010 and 2011 in order to better inform conservation decision-making for the species (The Aspinall Foundation 2009, King <em>et al. </em>2012), and showed that the distribution of <em>P. coronatus</em> was limited to forest patches in the area between the Mahavavy and Betsiboka Rivers in the north of its range, and between the Manambola, Tsibirhina (east of 45°E), Mania and Sakay Rivers in the extreme south of its range (Razafindramanana and Rasamimanana 2010, Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014, King <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is only one reported record east of the Ikopa River (of an extirpated population in the Ambohitantely Special Reserve), but this is considered to have arisen from an error in translation (S. Goodman in Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014), so the species distribution in the central part of the range should be considered to be between the Mahavavy and Ikopa Rivers rather than between the Mahavavy and Betsiboka Rivers as further north (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014). Melanistic sifaka occur in some populations of typically-coloured <em>P. coronatus</em> in the extreme south of the species range (Paulian 1953, cited by Petter and Peyrieras 1972, Razafindramanana and Rasamimanana 2010, King <em>et al.</em> 2014), possibly resulting from historic gene-flow with <em>P. deckenii</em> for <em>P. coronatus</em> populations located between the Manombolo and Tsibirhina Rivers, or with <em>P. verreauxi</em> for the most southerly known population located between the Mahajilo and Mania Rivers (King <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014). <em>P. coronatus</em> populations have been reported to occur from sea-level to almost 1,100m elevation (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014). Forest cover within the geographic range of <em>P. coronatus</em> is very fragmented, and is estimated at between 1,600 and 2,850 km² (King <em>et al.</em> 2014; based on a refined interpretation of the forest cover estimates provided by Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;&#160;&#160; </p><p>This species is likely affected by national trends in forest habitat loss: Madagascar lost 37% of its forest cover from 1973 to 2014, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.1%/year from 2010 to 2014.

Previous reports of its occurrence in two special reserves (Ambohijanahary and Kasijy) are considered erroneous (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014, King <em>et al.</em> 2014). The new protected area (NAP) of Antrema manages and protects the coastal forests neighboring Katsepy, since 2000 (Ancient RFUM), where <em>Propithecus coronatus</em> benefits from a strong traditional protection (<em>Fady</em>). Approximately two-thirds of the species range within protected areas occurs in the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetland Complex (Andriamasimanana and Cameron 2014), a new protected area promoted by Asity Madagascar. </p>  <p>There is a European captive breeding programme, with very few founders, but apparently showing some success (C.

Roullet <em>pers. comm.</em> 2019). &#160;Increased captive management of this species in Madagascar is recommended (C. Schwitzer <em>pers. comm.</em>); a properly established sifaka population would also be valuable for other future sifaka in captivity for <em>ex situ </em>conservation.<br/> <br/> South of these three new protected areas, several of the formerly unprotected forest fragments supporting the species identified recently by Razafindramanana and Rasamimanana (2010), King <em>et al.</em> (2012, 2014) and Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> (2014) are now the focus of community-based conservation projects run by The Aspinall Foundation (Anaboazo-Mangidirano, Kamotro-Liolava and Komadio-Ikay) or by Sifaka Conservation (Mahajeby, Ankirihitra-Mariarano, Dabolava and Mangabe-Mandrava forests). Several of these forests are now under the process of New Protected Area creation. The Sifaka Conservation project aims to establish a metapopulation management strategy to the conservation of the small and fragmented crowned sifaka populations and their habitats in Madagascar (Razafindramanana and Roullet 2011).&#160; The European captive population is included in this programme to ensure its long-term viability as a reserve population for possible future reintroduction (Roullet 2014), but also as a model for the wild populations.

There have been various confusing descriptions of the precise geographic range of <em>P. deckenii</em> in the past, which have been recently summarized by Thalmann <em>et al.</em> (2002), Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> (2014) and King <em>et al.</em> (2014).

Previous occasional reports of <em>P. deckenii</em> individuals just outside this range (i.e. east of the Mahavavy River or south of the Manambolo River) amongst otherwise <em>P. coronatus</em> populations (Tattersall 1982, 1988, Thalmann and Rakotoarison 1994) can probably be explained by rare and localized events of <em>P. deckenii</em> individuals crossing rivers or other biogeographical barriers by natural or human-induced methods such as releases or escapes of pet sifaka captured elsewhere (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014), and certainly do not represent the existence of established <em>P. deckenii</em> populations outside the range described above. </p>  <p>Melanistic forms of <em>P. deckenii</em> occur in several populations close to the Mahavavy River (see map in King <em>et al.</em> 2014). These forms vary from light forms with pale heads and only limited patches of dark colouration, through intermediate forms with darker heads and pelage coloration similar to that of typical <em>P. coronatus</em> to very dark forms which are very dark brown on large areas of the head, back, arms and legs, and which are unlike any typical sifaka species (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014).

Other surveyed forest fragments within the MKWC consist only of typical white individuals (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 1998, Thalmann <em>et al.</em> 2002). Melanistic individuals have also been reported from Kasijy Special Reserve; located approximately half-way between Ambohijanahary and MKWC, but appear to be few in number (Randrianarisoa <em>et al.</em> 2001). Melanistic infants have so far only been observed with melanistic adults, whilst typical white infants have been observed with both typical and melanistic adults (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014). Given that all localities where <em>P. deckenii</em> populations exhibit melanistic tendencies are close to the eastern limit of the species range, and therefore close to the range of <em>P. coronatus</em>, it is plausible that the underlying cause of the melanism is occasional gene flow with <em>P. coronatus</em>, however other hypotheses have been suggested and further work is clearly required (King <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014; Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;</p><p>This species is likely affected by national trends in forest habitat loss: Madagascar lost 37% of its forest cover from 1973 to 2014, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.1%/year from 2010 to 2014.

In the rainy season (November-April) ripe fruit and/or seeds can contribute more than 80% of the diet; in the lean season (May-October) this drops to about 20% and the majority of the diet is composed of leaves and/or flowers (Irwin 2008b; Irwin <em>et al.,</em> 2015; Kerker Oliver 2017; Powzyk 1997).

A single young is born between May and July, after a gestation of 179 days.&#160;Individuals may live up to 25 years in the wild. This species is diurnal and arboreal. In one study, these animals spent 54.5% of their time resting, 32.3% feeding, 5.7% moving, and 5.0% in social behaviour. This species has only twice been studied for a significant period of time (by Powzyk at Mantadia and Irwin at Tsinjoarivo). It lives in female-dominated, multi-male/multi -female groups of 2 to 8 individuals, consisting of 1–3 adult females and 1 or 2 adult males, and multiple females may breed within the same group. Home ranges of 20–80 ha are defended by means of scent-marking, although there is little home range overlap and little aggression over boundaries. Compared to the sympatric, similar -sized <em>Indri indri</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, <em>P. diadema </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">spends more time actively patrolling and defending its territories. The mean daily path length of 987– 1629 m for <em>P. diadema </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">can be compared to 774 m for <em>I. indri </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">(Powzyk 1997). As one of the largest lemurs, it is likely that their only natural predator is the fosa (<em>Cryptoprocta ferox</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">), though it is possible that some large raptors may pose a risk, especially for younger animals. Predation by fosa may be an important threat to this species, especially in fragmented or degraded areas where other prey species may be reduced (Irwin<em> et al. </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">2009). Males emigrate at roughly age five, often to a neighbouring group while females may either emigrate or remain in their natal group; most animals breed after five years of age but occasionally females that stay in their natal group have given birth at 4 years old (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> 2010 and references therein; Irwin unpublished data).</span></span></span></span></p><p></p>","<p>                  </p><p>Continued destruction of rainforest habitat in eastern Madagascar due to slash-and-burn agricultural practices and timber extraction is the principal threat to this sifaka’s survival.

Reports of hunting have increased dramatically since the last assessment, particularly in regions surrounding Andasibe and the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena, as well as northern parts of the species range.

The species is occasionally kept as a pet within Madagascar (Reuter and Schaefer 2017).

Therefore, the species is overall listed as Endangered.</p><p></p>","<p><em>Propithecus edwardsi</em> is found in primary and slightly degraded rainforests at middle to high elevations. This species is diurnal and primarily folivorous, though fruits, flowers, and seeds constitute major portions of its diet. Like other species within the <em>Propithecus</em> genus, <em>P. edwardsi </em>obtains protein from seed predation (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2012). The typical group size ranges from three to nine individuals, with territories of approximately 50 ha.&#160;Both males and females disperse, though males disperse three times throughout their lifetime while females disperse just twice (Wright <em>et al. </em>2012). Dispersal distance varies between individuals, with an observed maximum distance of 12-km by a male in Ranomafana National Park (P.C. Wright <em>pers. obs.</em>). Individuals are poor dispersers across fragmented habitats (Pochron <em>et al</em>. 2004, Gerber <em>et al</em>. 2012). Infants are typically born in June and July every other year after six months of gestation.&#160;High infant and adult mortalities are also noted in this species.&#160;Predation, especially by Fossa (<em>Cryptoprocta ferox</em>) is a significant cause of mortality, but some infant losses are also attributable to infanticidal males. Infant mortality has been calculated at almost 50% before the age of one year, but it is particularly high in disturbed forests (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2008, and references therein). In the longest demographic study of this species, the maximum lifespan of an individual reached 31 years (King <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, Wright <em>et al.</em> 2012). <em>P. edwardsi</em> reproduce slowly; however, older females continue to give birth until death (Wright&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;</p>  <p></p>","<p>Habitat destruction due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, gold mining, and illegal rum production represents the principal threat to this species’ survival. In addition to reducing this species’ range, habitat disturbance increases parasitism, which impacts lemur health and decreases population size (Wright&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). Fragmentation and forest destruction also increase predation risk by large-ranging predators, including Fossa (Irwin <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;On a larger-scale, it has been shown that this species is impacted by climate change, as infant mortality increases and fecundity decreases during ENSO years; this is significant, given recent predictions that cyclones and droughts will continue to increase in severity and frequency throughout Madagascar (Wright 2006, Dunham <em>et al</em>. 2008). Hunting represents an added anthropogenic pressure, as <em>Propithecus edwardsi </em>is a favoured prey item among hunters, who use slingshots, blowguns and firearms. Over an 18-year study, Dunham <em>et al. </em>(2008) showed that these threats have already negatively impacted survival and fecundity rates. </p>","<p>Nearly half of the total population is thought to occur in Ranomafana National Park, which has an estimated population size of 1,561 individuals at densities of 4.73 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2012).

Lehman <em>pers. comm</em>.). This local extirpation provides further evidence for steady population decline over the last 20 years (Lehman <em>et al. </em>2006), and this species is shown to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation (Eppley <em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>This species is suspected to have undergone a population decline of ≥50% over a period of 30 years (three generations), due primarily to hunting and habitat destruction (e.g. slash-and-burn agriculture and logging).<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;These pressures continue to augment, as evidenced by recent local extinctions north of Ranomafana to the Onive River.

Known at altitudes up to 400 m, but could occur in higher elevations (to 1,500 m) in the upper valley of the Río Sinu (Defler 2004).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet. The dentition of the tamarins (<em>Saguinus</em> and <em>Leontopithecus</em>) does not provide for gouging, and they eat gums only when readily available. <br/><br/>Tamarins live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals, but usually 2-8. <em>Saguinus oedipus</em> lives in groups of 2-9. Neyman (1977, 1979) observed groups of 3-13, Savage <em>et al. </em>(1996a,b) observed reproductively active groups that ranged in size from 3-6 and Gonzalez (2014) observed groups 1- 9.

Should future generations of cotton-top tamarins suffer from continued loss of suitable habitat at the current rate (not accounting for any additional increase, which is certainly possible), projected gross forest cover loss throughout the species range could be as high as 30%&#160; in the next 18 years (three generations).&#160; However, ground-truth studies in protected and unprotected forests (classified as having the same density of forest cover) indicate the absence of large trees essential for sustaining cotton-top tamarins in the latter, estimates of gross forest cover loss will significantly underestimate the amount of suitable habitat available to this species (A. Savage, unpublished data).&#160; In addition, population losses due to live capture for the pet trade are difficult to quantify, yet the threat remains significant based on continued and documented confiscations by conservation organizations (R.

They are almost exclusively frugivorous; as they are very selective feeders, they are especially susceptible to disturbance (e.g. see White <em>et al. </em>1995, Ratsimbazafy 2002, Seaman <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Vatovavy and Sangasanga, <em>Varecia</em> favour areas far from the forest edge, and areas with a large basal area of known food species. However, preferences did not result in total avoidance areas within fragments; they were ubiquitous across limited forests available (Note: this landscape is at lower elevation than RNP (100-600 m above sea level). See Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2008 and references therein.</a></p>  <p>Group size and structure appear to vary considerably between study sites (e.g. pairs: White 1989; cohesive MM-MF: Balko 1998; fission-fusion: Morland 1991, Vasey 2003, Baden 2011, Baden <em>et al.</em> 2016), as do patterns of reproductive timing. The species is said to exhibit ‘boom-bust’ reproductive strategies [e.g., one reproductive event documented in 6 years of observation (Baden 2011, Baden <em>et al. </em>2013); ‘reproductive collapse’ observed in congener <em>V. rubra</em> (Vasey and Borgerson 2009); long IBI during this same time in Kianjavato (Holmes, unpublished data)], possibly mitigated by climatic variation/resource availability/abundance]. In breeding years, females usually give birth to two to three young (mean, 2.7 infants/litter; Baden <em>et al. </em>2013), which are left in a nest when young and afterwards carried in the mother’s mouth (Baden 2011, Baden <em>et al.</em> 2013). During gestation, ruffed lemur mothers build several nests, the location and density of which has been linked to the distribution and availability of preferred food resources within the area (Baden 2019). Ruffed lemurs are probably the only primates that build nests exclusively for the birth and the first days of rearing infants (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2008, and references therein).</p>  <p>Population and landscape genetics of the species at a range-wide scale suggest that anthropogenic pressures—specifically deforestation and human occupation—are the primary drivers of genetic structure across remaining populations of this species (Baden <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2019). Comparison of the population genetics between fragmented and continuous landscapes in the southeast, in particular, suggest that small geographic separation may not be enough to disrupt gene flow among <em>V. variegata </em>populations. Rather, fragment isolation or age may play a greater role than fragment size in the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation (Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p><p></p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk28806173"">The principal threat to its survival is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging and mining. They are large bodied and diurnal, and therefore also among the most heavily hunted of all lemur species. The seasonality of their vocalizations (due to increased food availability) has been tied to increased levels of hunting (Ratsimbazafy 2002, Vasey 2003). In Makira, where they are one of the more expensive and desired meats, hunting is largely unsustainable (Golden 2005). It is one of the first lemurs to disappear where humans encroach upon rain forest habitats (White <em>et al</em>. 1995). Morelli <em>et al.</em> (2020) presented in a recent publication how climate change and deforestation would impact the genus <em>Varecia</em> in the eastern rain forest of Madagascar, indicating that both factors could act together or independently, depending on the geographic region; thus, impacting <em>Varecia variegata</em> subspecies singly.&#160;For instance, Morelli <em>et al</em>. (2020) presented that Makira could be impacted by climate change regardless if forest covered remained at 2014 levels; therefore, impacting <em>V. v. subcincta</em> populations. Alternatively, <em>V. v. variegata</em> populations in the Ankeniheny–Zahamena Corridor could be impacted by loss of suitable habitat by deforestation alone, but climate change would restrict suitable habitat to the more southern aspect of this corridor (Morelli <em>et al</em>. 2020). Finally, the southern extent of the <em>Varecia v. editorum</em> in the Fandriana–Vondrozo Corridor could be decimated by deforestation alone but combined would eliminate all suitable habitat (Morelli <em>et al</em>. 2020). </a></p>","<p>                  </p><p><a name=""_Hlk28805414"">Population declines are suspected to have occurred in the past and be ongoing. It is&#160;</a>suspected that this species has undergone a population decline of ≥80% over a period of 21 years (three generations), primarily due to observed and inferred continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat from slash-and-burn agriculture, logging and mining, in addition to exploitation through unsustainable hunting pressure.<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;Furthermore, a population reduction is inferred or projected to be met in the future within three generations.

However, as reported to Madagascar National Parks in 2004, the 500 ha island of Nosy Mangabe and the isolated nature of its lemur populations are considered under risk due to overpopulation as morphometric data indicates severely undersized weights of the <em>Varecia</em> <em>v</em>. <em>subcincta</em> (Nosy Mangabe avg. 2.49 kg; 10 individuals; avg. of two 2.95 kg pregnant females in mid-October versus the standard range of 3.1-3.6 kg (Morland, 1991, Baden <em>et al</em>. 2008)) and <em>Eulemur</em> <em>albifrons</em> (Nosy Mangabe avg. 1.7 kg; 10 individuals; two 2.05 kg pregnant females in October versus standard weight of 2.0 kg; Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2010, E. Louis <em>pers. comm.</em>). No <em>Varecia</em> were recorded during 2007 surveys at Manombo (also completely absent from nearby Agnalazaha and closest interior forests) suggesting that the Manombo population is small and likely has not recovered from Cyclone Gretelle in 1997 due to the continuing threats of hunting and deforestation in the reserve and classified forest sections of the protected area. Population densities are unknown for most other populations throughout the range of all three subspecies. In 2007, Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium’s Conservation Genetics team and the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership, NGO in collaboration with Andasibe/Mantadia National Park and Eaux et Forêt initiated a re-introduction program of the Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur, <em>V. v. variegata</em>, into Analamazaotra Special Reserve as this species and the Diademed sifaka, <em>Propithecus diadema</em>, had been extirpated from this protected area in the early 1970’s (Day <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160; The re-introduced Diademed Sifaka population has flourished, but unfortunately, hunting and other human impacts have limited the long-term survivability of the <em>Varecia</em> in this reserve (Rasoamanarivo <em>et al</em>. 2015). This approach does, however, show promise as a method of augmenting <em>Varecia</em> populations if the security of the forest can be established (Britt <em>et al.</em> 2003, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2013, Morelli <em>et al</em>. 2020). Unfortunately, <em>Varecia</em> is often specifically targeted by poachers as it is easily trapped in fruit-baited snares and for the flavour and quality of the meat (Golden 2005, Borgerson <em>et al</em>. 2016).</a></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><a name=""_Hlk28806460"">This species inhabits lowland to mid-altitude rain forests in eastern Madagascar from the Antainambalana River as its northern extent and Ambalavera Classified Forest which is just north of Midongy du Sud as its southerly recorded extent (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2013). The genus <em>Varecia</em> currently is represented by two species, <em>Varecia</em> <em>rubra,</em> the Red Ruffed Lemur,<em> </em>and<em> Varecia</em> <em>variegata, </em>the Black-and-white Ruffed Lemur. <em>Varecia</em> <em>rubra</em> has full species status whereas <em>Varecia</em> <em>variegata</em> includes three subspecies as follows: <em>Varecia</em> <em>v.</em> <em>subcincta</em>, <em>V</em>. <em>v</em>. <em>variegata</em>, and <em>V</em>. <em>v</em>. <em>editorum</em>.</a></p>  <p>The subspecies <em>V. v. subcincta</em> is thought to represent the northernmost subspecies with the northerly limit of its range being the Antainambalana River.&#160;<em>Varecia</em> <em>rubra</em> occupies the region east of the Antainambalana River, north until Antohaka-Lava Classified Forest, located southeast of Andapa (E. Patel<em>&#160;pers. comm.</em>) and the Masoala peninsula (Masoala National Park and World Heritage Site). There is some evidence of hybridization between <em>V. v. subcincta</em> and <em>V. rubra</em> in the region northeast of the Antainambalana River based on various patterns of coat colour; however, it hasn’t yet been extensively investigated utilizing molecular data (Vasey and Tattersall 2002). The southern range of <em>V.</em>&#160;<em>v. subcincta</em> is presumed to extend southwards to the Anova River, including part of Makira, Mananara-Nord, Atialanankorendrina, and Marotandrano protected areas. Furthermore, this subspecies was introduced to the island of Nosy Mangabe in the Bay of Antongil back in the 1930s and still occurs there (Kuhn 1972). The distribution of this lemur is very patchy throughout its range, except for Nosy Mangabe, where it lives at a relatively high density (Morland 1991).</p>  <p>The subspecies <em>V. v. variegata</em> occurs south of the Anova River from approximately Ambatovaky Special Reserve south to Betampona and Zahamena National Park. The northern extent of <em>V. v. variegata</em> and the southern range of <em>V. v. subcincta</em> have not been definitively defined; <em>V. v.</em> <em>variegata</em> is found in Ambatovaky, though its distribution throughout this reserve is unknown. Furthermore, the southern limit of <em>V. v. variegata</em> is also not yet clearly defined, but it is confirmed to be north of Mantadia National Park and Torotorofotsy Ramsar Site.</p>  <p>The subspecies <em>V. v. editorum</em> is the southernmost subspecies and is known with certainty only from Mantadia southwards to Manombo Special Reserve. There are additional populations of <em>V. variegata</em> south of Manombo Special Reserve at Ambalavera in the Midongy-Vondrozo Corridor (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2013) and also in small lowland forest fragments to the east of the Midongy-Vondrozo Corridor (Rakotonirina <em>et al.</em> 2013, The Aspinall Foundation unpubl. data); however, their subspecific status is not yet confirmed.</p>  <p>According to Groves (2001), the ranges of <em>V. v. editorum</em> and <em>V. v. variegata</em> overlap, and intermediate forms exist.

The relatively abundant Andriantantely population has become the focus of community-based conservation activities since 2010 (King <em>et al.</em> 2013, Seaman <em>et al.</em> 2018). Although the <em>Varecia v. editorum</em> population was extirpated from Analamazaotra Special Reserve in the early 1970’s, a re-introduction/translocation programme was initiated in 2006 which initially was promising. Unfortunately, hunting continues to impact this population. After growing to 25 individuals in five groups (2017) from a founding population of seven individuals, reports suggest that this population is now fewer than 15 individuals (E. Louis, <em>pers. obs.</em>). In November 1997, <em>V. v. editorum</em> born and raised in US zoological institutions were returned to Madagascar and released in the Betampona Reserve (Britt <em>et al.</em> 2003); however, predation by fossa (<em>Cryptoprocta</em> <em>ferox</em>) significantly impacted this re-inforcement programme.</p>  <p>Clarification of the taxonomic status of this species and species boundaries and distribution is a top priority.&#160;An education campaign against hunting, using this species as a flagship, is also recommended.</p>  <p>Over 800 <em>V. variegata</em> are held in captivity globally, in six regions (ZIMS 2019). In Europe, the species is managed in two separate breeding programmes (EEPs): one for individuals of the <em>V. v. subcincta</em> subspecies, the other for all other individuals (Johann<em> et al.</em> 2018). The <em>V. v. subcincta</em> EEP population comprises around 75 individuals but all descended from just four founder individuals and therefore has very low genetic diversity (Johann <em>et al.</em> 2018). The non-<em>subcincta</em> EEP population comprises approximately 350 individuals descended from 18 founders (Johann <em>et al.</em> 2018). The North American captive population is smaller at around 170 individuals, but is descended from 27 founders and is therefore considered more genetically diverse than the European population (Johann <em>et al.</em> 2018); however, it is not managed with respect of current subspecific taxonomy. Additional captive animals not included in the above figures are held in Madagascar, including approximately 45 in recognised facilities (E. Robsomanitrandrasana, <em>in. litt.</em> 2016) and several in illegal captivity (Reuter and Schafer 2017). A recent genetic study of mitochondrial DNA D-Loop sequences from ruffed lemurs in captivity in Europe and Madagascar illustrated that the European population had lower mtDNA diversity than the North American captive population, and that the Madagascan captive population had higher diversity than both (Vega <em>et al.</em> 2019). One of the haplotypes in the European population was not represented in the Madagascan captive population, and all haplotypes reported from the three captive populations were either identical to, or clustered with, published haplotypes from wild populations located north of the Mangoro River (Vega <em>et al. </em>2019).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

This species has been the subject of ecological and behavioural studies in the forests of Ambatonakolahy (Rigamonti 1993), Andranobe on the Masoala Peninsula (Vasey 1997a, 2000, 2002, 2005, Martinez 2010, Borgerson 2016). The mating season is May-July, with births occurring from September through early November after a gestation period of about 102 days. Litters range from one to five infants in captivity, but usually contain two or three, and only one young every two years normally survive (Brockman <em>et al. </em>1987, Schwitzer 2003). Interbirth intervals are in the order of one to two years (Rakotondratsima and Kremen 2001). Females reach sexual maturity at just under two years, while males take three to four years to attain maturity.

One of the best predictors of <em>V. rubra</em> population size is the total crown volume of large trees in that area (Borgerson 2016).&#160;<em>V. rubra</em> are highly frugivorous seed dispersers with fruits accounting for 61% of their diet (Martinez and Razafindratsimba 2014).&#160; They consistently use trees with the largest DBH, greatest height, and most voluminous crowns (Rigamonti 1993, Vasey 2000, 2002).

115576640,39994,Gorilla beringei,Critically Endangered,A4bcd,2019,2018-08-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Eastern Gorillas (<em>Gorilla beringei</em>) live in the mountainous forests of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, northwest Rwanda and southwest Uganda. This region was the epicentre of Africa's ""world war"", to which Gorillas have also fallen victim. The Mountain Gorilla subspecies (<em>Gorilla beringei beringei</em>), was listed as Critically Endangered since 1996. Although a drastic reduction of the Grauer’s Gorilla subspecies (<em>Gorilla beringei graueri</em>), has long been suspected, quantitative evidence of the decline has been lacking (Robbins and Williamson 2008). During the past 20 years, Grauer’s Gorillas have been severely affected by human activities, most notably poaching for bushmeat associated with artisanal mining camps and for commercial trade (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). This illegal hunting has been facilitated by a proliferation of firearms resulting from widespread insecurity in the region. Previously estimated to number around 16,900 individuals, recent surveys show that Grauer’s Gorilla numbers have dropped to only 3,800 individuals – a 77% reduction in just one generation (<em>ibid</em>.) This rate of population loss is almost three times above that which qualifies a species as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>Mountain Gorillas have been faring substantially better; one of the two subpopulations is recovering from an all-time low in the 1980s, making Mountain Gorillas the only great ape taxon that has been increasing in number (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013). A 2015–2016, survey of the Virunga population has confirmed that it is still growing and has now increased to over 600 individuals, bringing the total population to roughly 1,000 (Hickey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Grauer's Gorillas continue to decline at an average rate of 5% per year (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Even with the growth of the Mountain Gorilla subspecies, the overall decline of the Eastern Gorilla species is expected to exceed 80% over three generations due to the high levels of poaching, loss of habitat as human populations expand, and civil unrest and lawlessness in parts of this species’ geographic range. If unabated, in 2054, only 14% of the 1994 population will remain. Therefore, Eastern Gorillas qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion A (A4bcd).","Grauer's Gorillas range between 600 and 2,900 m asl in dense mature and secondary lowland tropical rainforest through transitional forests to Afromontane habitat, including bamboo forest, swamp and peat bog. Mountain Gorillas are restricted to elevations above 1,400 m in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and above 1,850 m in the Virungas by human occupation at lower levels. Their habitat includes many Afromontane vegetation types, including bamboo forest, mixed forest, and subalpine grassland on the volcanic peaks. The Bwindi Mountain Gorillas live at lower elevations, in forest characterised by steep slopes of predominantly mixed forest habitat with a dense understorey.<br/><br/>Diets of Eastern Gorillas vary greatly with elevation and its effect on food availability. Mountain Gorillas are largely herbivorous and feed on stems, pith, leaves, bark, and occasionally ants. Their favoured food items are wild celery, thistles, nettles, bedstraw, wood and roots. Both subspecies feed almost exclusively on young bamboo shoots when they are in season twice a year. Gorillas at lower elevations have a more diverse and seasonal diet. Both Grauer’s Gorillas in lowland forest and Bwindi Gorillas are frugivorous.<br/><br/>Eastern Gorillas are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. After waking, they feed intensively and then alternate rest, travelling and feeding until night-time. All Gorillas build nests to sleep in, some in trees, but the majority of their nests are on the ground. Gorillas are not territorial, and there is extensive overlap between the annual home ranges of different groups, which vary in size from 6–40 km². Eastern Gorilla groups are polygynous or polygynandrous, with one or more adult males, several females, their offspring, and immature relatives forming the core of relatively stable groups. Median group size is 10 weaned individuals; maximum observed group size is 65 individuals.<br/><br/><u><strong>Life History</strong></u> (as summarised in Williamson and Butynski 2013)<br/>Male Eastern Gorillas are capable of reproducing when they become “blackbacks” at 8-12 years of age. They are considered “silverbacks” at 12 years of age, and reach their full adult size at 15 years. Female menarche occurs at 6-7 years of age, followed by a period of adolescent sterility. Average age of first parturition is 9.9 years. Females have a reproductive cycle of <em>ca</em> 28 days and are receptive for 1-4 days around the time of ovulation. They experience lactational amenorrhea while suckling infants. Young are weaned at 3-4 years of age, from which point they no longer travel on their mothers’ back. Females give birth every 3-4 years and generally produce 3-4 surviving offspring during their reproductive life span. Maximum life span is unknown, but it is certainly over 40 years. Eastern Gorillas have a generation time of 18.2 years for females and 20.4 years for males (Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Major threats to Eastern Gorillas are:<br/><ol><li><strong><u>Poaching</u> </strong>- Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, hunting represents the greatest threat to Grauer’s Gorillas (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). A high demand for bushmeat stems from the growing human population, the destabilising impact of armed groups, artisanal miners in remote areas and a general scarcity of affordable domestic protein in rural areas. The permanent presence of people who provide the workforce for exploitation of natural resources also constitutes a major factor in this problem. Miners working in national parks have admitted to poaching Gorillas, which are relatively easy to hunt with guns and provide large quantities of meat (Kirkby <em>et al</em>. 2015). Illegal capture of live infants is a secondary threat (after the mother has been killed and eaten), except on occasions when Mountain Gorilla infants have been the principle target, fulfilling the demands of a fictitious, international market. These orphans usually die or are seized by the wildlife authorities.</li><li><strong><u>Habitat loss and degradation</u></strong> - Agricultural and pastoral activities are leading to continued loss and fragmentation of Gorilla habitat in DRC. At present, there is no commercial logging in the Eastern Gorilla’s range, but there is continuous artisanal extraction of resources, which puts added stress on natural habitats. Illegal mining has decimated the lowlands of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, a Grauer’s Gorilla stronghold. Destruction of forest for timber, charcoal production and agriculture continues to threaten the isolated Gorilla populations that persist in North Kivu and the Itombwe Massif.</li><li><u><strong>Civil unrest</strong></u> - For two decades, refugees, internally-displaced people and numerous armed groups have placed enormous pressure on DRC’s forests through uncontrolled habitat conversion for farmland, harvesting of firewood, timber extraction and mining. Ongoing political unrest and military activity, including rebel occupation of national parks have compounded other threats (Yamagiwa 2003, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). A recent survey identified 69 armed groups operating in North and South Kivu (Stearns &amp; Vogel 2015), covering important portions of remaining Grauer’s Gorilla range. Armed conflict and the collapse of law and order in DRC brought a significant rise in the illegal circulation of military weapons and ammunition. Former traditional hunters have obtained guns, notably AK47s, and the commercial trade in bushmeat increased with the spread of firearms, often supplied by government soldiers and rebel militia. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Virunga Mountain Gorillas were also impacted by war and instability (Kalpers <em>et al</em>. 2003, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2011).</li><li><u><strong>Disease</strong></u> - Regulated tourism is a key strategy for Eastern Gorilla conservation; however, transmission of human diseases is a major concern (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015), as is excessive disturbance to Gorillas and their habitat (Macfie and Williamson 2010), which could jeopardize conservation programmes. Examples of likely or proven human-­to-­great ape disease transmission include respiratory viruses (Köndgen <em>et al</em>. 2008, Palacios <em>et al</em>. 2011, Spelman <em>et al</em>. 2013), human herpes simplex virus (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2014) and scabies (Kalema-Zikusoka <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some of these cases have been fatal and most have involved habituated Gorillas or Chimpanzees. Nonetheless, Mountain Gorillas visited by researchers and tourists have consistently shown higher population growth rates than unhabituated Gorillas, which is likely due to the daily monitoring of habituated groups. Continuous monitoring leads to better protection and facilitates veterinary interventions to remove snares and treat respiratory illnesses (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2011); it is almost impossible to treat unhabituated Gorillas.</li><li><strong><u>Climate change</u></strong> - Climate change is predicted to impact the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment, leading to the upslope migration of species and key Gorilla habitat, notably montane forest (Ayebare <em>et al</em>. 2013). Increased temperatures and modified rainfall patterns are also likely to result in changes in food availability and habitat quality (McGahey <em>et al</em>. 2013). With almost all montane forest in the eastern highlands now destroyed and converted for agriculture to support some of the highest human population densities in the African Great Lakes region, climate change may have negative effects on food security for the human populations surrounding Gorilla habitat, which could also conservation efforts in the future.</li></ol>","It is likely that fewer than 5,000 Eastern Gorillas remain.&#160;<em>Gorilla b. beringei</em>&#160;lives in two isolated populations in three countries: DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. The first surveys of the Virunga Mountain Gorillas estimated a population size of 274 individuals in 1971–73 (Harcourt and Groom 1972, Groom 1973). The population fell to a low of 254 individuals in 1981 (Aveling and Harcourt 1981, Weber and Vedder 1983). Since then, protection measures have enabled the population to recover and the most recent estimate for the Virungas is a minimum of 600 individuals (Hickey <em>et al</em>. 2018). The second (Bwindi-Sarambwe) Mountain Gorilla population numbers about 400 individuals (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Thus, the total population of the subspecies is now at least 1,000 individuals (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2014, Hickey <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In 1994–95, the total population of <em>G. b. graueri</em> was estimated to be 16,900 individuals (Hall <em>et al</em>. 1998a, 1998b). Since then, widespread insecurity and poaching for bushmeat, particularly around mining camps, have led to increasing fragmentation of the population and rapid reductions of numbers. Using survey data collected between 2010 and 2015, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated that the number of Grauer's Gorillas remaining in 2015 is only 3,800—a 77% loss since 1994-95. These population estimates were made using night nest abundance and distribution, and predictive modelling. Nest encounter rates indicate an ongoing rate of decline of ~5% per year at many of the sites surveyed, due to fragmentation and illegal hunting around the many artisanal mining camps and villages located in areas where Grauer's Gorillas occur (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"Eastern Gorillas are found in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), northwest Rwanda and southwest Uganda.<br/><br/><em>Gorilla beringei beringei</em> (Matschie 1903) is restricted to two populations in forests only 25 km apart, but isolated by land that is intensely cultivated and densely settled. One population is in the Virunga Volcanoes, straddling the borders between DRC (Virunga National Park), Rwanda (Volcanoes National Park) and Uganda (Mgahinga Gorilla National Park). The other occurs in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, with a small contiguous portion in Sarambwe Nature Reserve in DRC.<br/><br/><em>Gorilla beringei graueri</em> (Matschie 1914) is endemic to the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment in eastern DRC. It has a discontinuous distribution from the lowlands east of the Lualaba River to the Mitumba Mountains and the Itombwe Massif. Mt. Tshiaberimu in Virunga National Park is the northern limit of Grauer’s Gorilla’s geographic range. The southern limit is a subpopulation in the Hewa Bora region, Fizi District (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Although formerly known as the Eastern Lowland Gorilla, <em>G. b. graueri</em> occurs over the widest altitudinal range of any Gorilla, from approximately 600 m to 2,900 m asl, overlapping considerably with the altitudinal range of <em>G. b. beringei</em> (1,400–3,800 m asl; Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013).","<p>Gorillas are completely protected by national and international laws in all countries of their range, and it is, therefore, illegal to kill, capture or trade in live Gorillas or their body parts.<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<em>Gorilla beringei</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES, and under Class A of the African Convention (as the species <em>Gorilla</em>). DRC has a legal framework for managing national parks and wildlife, but has difficulty applying its laws, and political will is limited. Underlying this is a difficult sociopolitical context – a breakdown of law and order during two decades of conflict, combined with poverty and economic insecurity, exacerbates the difficulties of enforcing the law in this region. To address the critical situation faced by Grauer’s Gorillas, NGOs are working with the government authorities to support protected areas and reinforce conservation programmes. However, the widespread presence of armed groups in eastern DRC restricts the ability of conservation organisations to operate in the field.<br/><br/>One quarter of the predicted range of the Grauer’s Gorillas occurs in national parks and nature reserves; the remaining three quarters is currently unprotected (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Gazetting of the Itombwe Reserve and establishing a protected area west of Kahuzi-Biega National Park could secure as much as 50% of the subspecies' range.<br/><br/>Conservation challenges are likely to increase as the DRC government continues its efforts to stabilize the east. Security will favour industrial extraction, large-scale agriculture and infrastructure. While development will increase the country's ability to support its human population and participate in the global economy, it will also result in increased human settlement in forest areas critical to Gorillas. Targeted conservation action in priority sites will be vital to slow further demise of this subspecies.<br/><br/>The entire Mountain Gorilla population resides in protected areas where there are active government programmes. Although the protected areas are relatively well monitored, illegal activities continue in some locations, therefore monitoring the impacts of both illegal activities and conservation actions should continue. While these national parks are legally protected, habitat fragmentation and degradation will be exacerbated if infrastructure developments are allowed within their boundaries.<br/><br/>To achieve conservation successes, long-term commitment is key, as shown by the international conservation organisations that have been working in difficult circumstances for decades to support the protected area authorities and try to secure the survival of Eastern Gorillas. IUCN has published a detailed conservation strategy with clear priorities for Grauer’s Gorillas (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2012). See Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2015) for additional recommendations and see Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2011) for an overview of the impacts of conservation activities on mountain Gorillas in the Virunga Massif.<br/><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Home range sizes are variable, ranging from 6.60 – 18.39 ha (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2016b). At Kalambatritra Special Reserve and Mandena Conservation Area, individuals exhibit latrine behaviour (repeated group defecation at specific sites); groups defecate in turn, with adults going first followed by juveniles. It is thought that this likely serves some communicatory function, possibly for demarcating territory and mate-guarding (Eppley <em>et al. </em>2016b).</p>  <p>Similar to other bamboo lemur species, <em>Hapalemur</em>&#160;<em>meridionalis</em> is classified as a folivore (Eppley <em>et al. </em>2011, 2016a). In Mandena, groups have been observed to spend significant amounts of time on the ground, foraging terrestrially on various grass (<em>Poaceae</em>) and reed (Cyperaceae) species within the littoral forest, in open-canopy areas, and within marsh / swamp areas (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2016a). These flooded forest and marsh habitats appear to be important for the individuals populating the littoral coastal forest (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2015a), with groups even observed in the reed marshes along the estuaries by Evahtra. Within the littoral forest, this species has been recorded to feed on 72 different species from 37 plant families (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2016a). Though the majority of their diet is composed of terrestrial grasses, piths, and liana stems/leaves, they also consumed 34 different fruit species (Eppley <em>et al. </em>2011, 2016a). This species often selects for resting sites with large diameter at breast height (DBH) within the degraded littoral forest (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2017b). Brief observations from more continuous humid forests (e.g., Andohahela National Park, Tsitongambarika Protected Area) have noted this species feeding on various woody and liana bamboo species (Feistner and Schmid 1999; T.

The species inhabits both primary and mature secondary forests. Irrespective of the differences in overall structure and habitat parameters of the forest fragments in Ankarafa, the microhabitat in sportive lemurs’ home ranges as well as around sleeping sites was similar in all measured habitat parameters, as were all measured parameters for the different sleeping trees (Seiler <em>et al.</em> 2013b, 2014). Sahamalaza Sportive Lemurs chose the locations of their home ranges on the basis of different habitat variables, with abundance of sleeping sites and feeding trees as well as tree density and canopy cover being the most important factors (Seiler<em> et al. </em>2014). Tall trees with large crowns, a high density of small trees, and dense canopy were particularly important for sleeping site choice (Seiler <em>et al.</em> 2013b). </p>  <p>The Sahamalaza Sportive Lemur is a highly folivorous generalist herbivore and has been observed to feed on at least 42 different tree species, preferring the abundant species <em>Clitoria lasciva, Mangifera indica, Garcinia pauciflora</em> and <em>Sorindeia madagascariensis</em> and occasionally adding fruits of <em>Ficus tiliaefolia</em>, spiders, insects and insect larvae to its diet. It has prolonged periods of resting during its activity periods (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2014). Home ranges covered an area of 1.4 ha (nightly ranges of 0.5 ha) and did not overlap between adult individuals (Seiler 2012). The very few sociopositive interactions between individuals took place between mother and kin. Although the small number of observed individuals makes it hard to finally conclude on the social organization of the Sahamalza Sportive Lemur, the low level of social interaction and cohesiveness suggest that the Sahamalaza Sportive Lemur has a very low degree of social complexity and is likely to be solitary (Seiler 2012).</p>  <p>During daylight hours the Sahamalaza Sportive Lemur rested alone (except mother-infant pairs) in tree holes or in tree tangles (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2013b). Tree holes used as sleeping sites were usually found in <em>Bridelia pervilleana</em>, whilst tree tangle sleeping sites are mostly located in <em>Sorindeia madagascariensis</em>. Individuals resting in tree holes usually sat at the entrance rather than inside the hole, possibly to increase sun exposure. During diurnal observations, 5-14 % of the sportive lemurs’ behaviour was active, although the animals never leave their sleeping sites or feed. Comparing the proportion of active behaviour between individuals resting in tree holes and those in tree tangles, animals in tree holes to have significantly higher levels of activity (Seiler <em>et al.</em> 2013b). </p>  <p>Resting <em>Lepilemur sahamalaza</em> recognized predator vocalizations as indicators of increased predation risk, discerned vocalizations of different predators, and employed species-specific anti-predator behaviours (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2013c). Furthermore, the studied Sahamalaza Sportive Lemurs were able to use information on predator presence and predator type in referential signals of different surrounding species, thereby taking advantage of the possibility of early predator detection through interspecific communication (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2013d).</p><p></p>","<p>Although some of the known distribution is within a protected area, forest clearing for agriculture, and timber-cutting for charcoal and construction continues at high rates, especially since the onset of the political crisis in Madagascar in 2009.

Ruperti (2007) recorded a mean density of 280 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in Ankarafa. Most recent data on <em>Lepilemur</em> density (Seiler <em>et al.</em> 2013a) suggests densities ranging from only 7 to 23 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in the same area. The differences between density estimations are most likely due to different methods of data collection. Whereas Ruperti measured lemur density inside one-hectare plots (one for each fragment), Seiler <em>et al.</em> counted all individuals found during 12 months of field work. Another factor that may have contributed to the differences is ongoing habitat alteration. During the study period from 2009 to 2011, various observations were made of illegal logging (often hardwoods), slash-and-burn agriculture and poaching of the sportive lemurs on the Sahamalaza Peninsula (Seiler <em>et al. </em>2010,&#160;2012).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Lepilemur sahamalaza </em>is restricted to the Sahamalaza Peninsula.

The Madagascar ground boa is known to prey upon sportive lemurs in their sleeping sites. A study of this species in degraded secondary forest fragments south of Montagne d’Ambre National Park found that the animals eat a high proportion of fruits during the rainy season when fruits are abundant, whereas they only eat leaves during the dry season. The fruits of five plant families were consumed: Moraceae, Verbenaceae, Rubiaceae, Pittosporaceae, and one that was not identified. The species has also been observed to feed on latex (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2008 and references therein).","The major threats to this species are forest loss, particularly for charcoal (such as in Analamerana and Andrafiamena), and hunting (exacerbated by mining in the region for sapphires).

In contrast to the solitary&#160;<em>Mirza coquereli</em>, the gregarious&#160;<em>M. zaza</em>&#160;sleeps in groups of 2 to 8 animals including several males with fully developed testes (Kappeler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Rode 2010). Only 1–3 nests were used in a 50-day observation period, which indicates a high preference for and/or a scarcity of nest sites (Rode 2010).

120588662,120588639,Pongo tapanuliensis,Critically Endangered,A4bcd,2017,2017-10-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to high levels of habitat conversion and fragmentation, and illegal killing, <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in recent decades. Forest loss data indicate that orangutan habitat below 500 m asl of both <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> and <em>P. abelii</em> was reduced by 60% between 1985 and 2007 (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2011). It is thought that this reduction will continue for the Tapanuli Orangutan as forests within its range remain under considerable threat (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2016). Significant areas of the Tapanuli Orangutan’s range are seriously threatened by habitat conversion for small-scale agriculture, mining exploration and exploitation, a large-scale hydroelectric scheme, geothermal development, and agricultural plantations. Approximately 14% of the geographic range of the Tapanuli Orangutan is not protected, nor even allocated as forest estate, and even the protected areas are not immune from the above threats (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2011, 2016). The Tapanuli Orangutan is also hunted (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2012). Due to their slow life history, with a generation time of at least 25 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009), orangutans on Sumatra are unable to sustain substantial and continual loss of individuals. A quantitative population viability analysis estimated that in 1985 there were ~1,489 individuals of the Tapanuli Orangutan, and that these would decline to only 257 over a 75-year period to 2060 (Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme unpublished data). With current management, the key threats of loss of lowland habitat and hunting are not being effectively reduced, and we therefore predict an 83% decline over the course of three generations. The species therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered under criterion A4.","<p>Despite a complex geological history, the underlying parent material within the geographic range of <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> consists primarily of recent (i.e., Quaternary, &lt;2.588 Ma) igneous rock, most of which is acidic volcanic rock from the Toba super-eruption of ~74 ka (Subardja <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oppenheimer 2002, Barber <em>et al</em>. 2005). This is in stark contrast to the north Sumatran Orangutan population that persists in forests atop older (i.e., Tertiary and above, &gt;2.588 Ma) igneous and sedimentary rock (Darul Sukma <em>et al</em>. 1990a, 1990b, 1990c, 1990d, Hidayat <em>et al</em>. 1990, Hikmatullah <em>et al</em>. 1990, Wahyunto <em>et al</em>. 1990, Barber <em>et al</em>. 2005). While comparative data in the format analysed for Sumatra are lacking for Borneo, previously published reconstructions of Borneo’s geology highlighted a complex geological history that was in general different from that of Sumatra. This includes large swaths of landscape with pre-Cenozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rock, with comparatively fewer areas characterized by igneous rock formations (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Using freely available WorldClim data (Hijmans <em>et al</em>. 2005), <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> can be differentiated from <em>P. abelii</em> by a highly narrow ecological niche, including a restricted upland elevation range (<em>P. abelii</em>: 701.7±454.8 m asl; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 834.4±219.3 m asl), cooler average temperatures (<em>P. abelii</em>: 23.3±2.5°C; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 22.1±1.2°C), and relatively high levels of average yearly rainfall (<em>P. abelii</em>: 2,435.1±460.5 mm/year; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 2,607.5±231.2 mm/year). Similarly, compared to <em>P. pygmaeus</em>, <em>P. tapanuliensis </em>occurs at much higher elevation (<em>P. pygmaeus</em>: 170.6±187.0 m asl; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 834.4±219.3 m asl), and experiences far lower average temperatures (<em>P. pygmaeus</em>: 26.0±1.0°C; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 22.1±1.2°C), and lower levels of average rainfall (<em>P. pygmaeus</em>: 2,827.3±420.9 mm/year; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 2,607.5±231.2 mm/year). At SOCP’s long-term monitoring station, average monthly temperature from 2009–2015 was recorded as 22.0°C (±0.89°C, n=83 months), with a monthly range of 20.5–24.2°C, whereas average total rainfall from 2009–2015 was recorded as 3,654 mm per year (±390.0 mm, n=7 years), with a yearly range of 3,186-4,210 mm (SOCP unpublished data).<br/><br/>Provided that climate, parent material, and time are key factors in soil formation/quality, and thus forest productivity/quality (Tan 2008, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bockheim <em>et al</em>. 2014), the aforementioned factors are key distinctions between the <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> and most Bornean and north Sumatran Orangutan populations. A recent study showed that forest compositions experienced by <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> are at present mainly known from upland areas of southern Sumatra and Borneo, areas that notably do not currently maintain orangutan populations (Slik <em>et al</em>. 2011). They are largely restricted to primary forest, though they do venture into disturbed habitat at forest edges.<br/><br/>As noted by Wich and colleagues (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014), <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> was observed feeding on a number of tree species that had not previously been recorded as orangutan food species. These unique species include <em>Agathis borneensis</em> from the Araucariaceae family, <em>Gymnostoma sumatranum</em> from the Casuarinaceae family, and <em>Dacrycarpus imbricatus</em>, <em>Dacrydium beccarii</em>, <em>Dacrydium comosum</em>, and <em>Podocarpus neriifolius</em> from the Podocarpaceae family. To our knowledge, occasional feeding on species from these families had only been documented in Gunung Palung, Borneo (fruits of an unidentified <em>Agathis</em> species and vegetation of an unknown <em>Casuarina</em> species [Casuarinaceae]), and Ketambe, Sumatra (bark of <em>Sundacarpus amara</em> [Podocarpaceae]) (Russon&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). In contrast, the five aforementioned conifer species (Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae) and one non-conifer evergreen species (Casuarinaceae) represent 21.9% of all feeding observations (n=58,558 two-minute instantaneous samples) recorded between 2011 and 2015 at SOCP’s long-term monitoring station in the Batang Toru Ecosystem (SOCP unpublished data). Thus, a significant proportion of the dietary profile of Tapanuli Orangutans is markedly different from that of previously studied orangutan populations.</p>","Due to the extremely rugged terrain, external threats have been primarily limited to illegal clearing of protected forests, hunting and killing during crop conflict, and trade in young orangutans (Wich&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012,&#160;Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016<a href=""#_ENREF_32"" title=""Wich, 2016 #15187""></a>). Encroachment and hunting have increased in recent decades, due to an influx of migrants from Nias Island, west of Sumatra, who settle on protected forest land on Batang Toru’s forest edge where no land claims exist at present (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). In addition, despite land status changes from production forest to that of protection forest in 2014 (Ministry of Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia&#160;2014), one company still maintains a controversial 300 km² logging permit located in primary forest within the current range of <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em>. In the southwest corner of the Batang Toru Forest Complex a gold and silver mine is located, which has recently converted <em>ca</em> 3 km² of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> habitat and retains controversial mining permits overlapping parts of the remaining <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> range. Uncontested land speculation related to the company’s exploration is further threatening the primary forest. More recently, a hydro-electric development has been proposed in the area of highest orangutan density, which could impact roughly 100 km² of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> habitat, or nearly 10% of the entire species population. It could also jeopardize the chances of maintaining habitat corridors between the western and eastern <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> ranges, and with two smaller strict nature reserves, which could also maintain small populations of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>.","<p>With a population estimate of fewer than 800 individuals (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016), <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> is the least numerous of all great ape species. Its distribution is separated by around 100 km from the closest population of <em>P. abelii</em> to the north. A combination of small population size and geographic isolation is of particularly high conservation concern, as it may lead to inbreeding depression (Hedrick and Kalinowski 2000) and threaten population persistence (Allendorf <em>et al</em>. 2013). Highlighting this, a recent study (Nater <em>et al</em>. 2017) discovered extensive runs of homozygosity in the genomes of two <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> individuals, pointing at the occurrence of recent inbreeding.<br/><br/>Only about 10% of the geographic range is in an area recognized by the World Database of Protected Areas. Another 76% is in Hutan Lindung (Protection Forest), and 14% does not have any 'forest status' in the spatial plans, despite the fact that it consists of rugged primary forest with the highest densities of Tapanuli Orangutans in the Batang Toru Ecosystem (SOCP unpublished data). This roughly translates to 8% of the total distribution located in nationally recognized conservation area (Cagar Alam, Strict Nature Reserve), 78% in Protection Forest (Hutan Lindung), and the remaining 14% of the range is entirely unprotected.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>For much of the 20th century, orangutans on Sumatra were thought to be restricted to the north and west of Lake Toba, in and around the Leuser Ecosystem. Populations south of Lake Toba were overlooked, even though a 1939 review of the species’ range mentioned that orangutans had been reported in several forest areas in that region (Nederlandsch-Indische Vereeniging tot Natuurbescherming 1939). It was not until 1997 that these isolated orangutan populations were rediscovered (Meijaard 1997, Rijksen and Meijaard 1999). As a consequence of further sightings, published in 2003 (Wich&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003), a study of the southern populations started in 2005 when the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme (SOCP) began a conservation project in the mountainous Batang Toru region with the intent of conserving the orangutan population and their remaining habitat south of Lake Toba.<br/><br/>The only known population of <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> occurs in the uplands of the Batang Toru Ecosystem, an area of roughly 1,500&#160;km² consisting of three forest blocks, of which 1,022&#160;km²&#160;is suitable orangutan habitat (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016). <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> is the least numerous of all great ape species.<br/><br/><em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> was until relatively recently more widespread, with sightings further south in the lowland peat swamp forests in the Lumut area (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2003) and several nests encountered during a rapid survey in 2010 (G. Fredriksson pers. obs.). The forests in the Lumut area have in recent years almost completely been converted to oil-palm plantations. In 2008, a captive Tapanuli Orangutan was confiscated in Lumut. Observation were also made of a male orangutan in the Dolok Ginjang area, just north of the Batang Toru West forest block in the Adiankoting subdistrict in North Tapanuli, during a human conflict situation where an orangutan was shot at with an air rifle when it was found foraging on durian fruits (G. Fredriksson pers. obs.). Recent surveys in this area did not find any orangutan nests (Nowak <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>A hunting trip report from 1879 described orangutan encounters near the small town of Mantinggi, south of the current population (0°58’ N, 100°0’ E) (Kramm 1879). In 1902, orangutan signs and reports were noted along several small rivers on the south side of the Sibolga Bay, west of Batang Toru (Miller 1903). Unsubstantiated reports suggest that orangutans, presumably <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>, may have occurred even further south in Sumatra in historic periods. A number of museum specimens are claimed to have come from Padang, Palembang and Jambi (Schlegel and Müller 1839–1844,&#160;Beccari 1904, Hooijer 1948, Veracini <em>et al</em>. 2010), and an orangutan kill was reported in 1930 near Palembang and along the Musi River toward the base of the Barisan Mountain range (Delmont 1930). These accounts suggest that isolated individuals or small populations of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> may have survived outside the current range well into the 1900s, although without studying specimens from these areas, we cannot exclude that they could be <em>P. abelii</em>. Despite the distance to the south and their rarity, such reports are perhaps not surprising, as orangutans are long lived and isolated individuals or populations could potentially exist in fragmented landscapes for &gt;50 years, provided that food resources were available and stochastic processes were rare.</p>","It is illegal to capture, injure, kill, own, keep, transport, or trade an orangutan.",Terrestrial,"<p>To ensure the long-term survival of <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em>, conservation measures need to be implemented swiftly. Due to the rugged terrain, external threats have been primarily limited to illegal clearing of forests, hunting, killings during crop conflict and trade in orangutans (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016<a href=""#_ENREF_31"" title=""Wich, 2016 #43""></a>). A hydroelectric development has been proposed recently in the area of highest orangutan density, which could impact nearly 10% of <em>P. tapanuliensis’</em> population. This project might lead to further genetic impoverishment and inbreeding, as it would jeopardize chances of maintaining habitat corridors between the western and eastern range, and smaller nature reserves, all of which maintain small populations of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>.<br/><br/>The Tapanuli Orangutan is also protected by international legislation by default because it is included within the old concept of <em>P. abelii</em> which is listed on CITES Appendix I.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Lowland swamp, pre-montane forests up to ~1,000 m asl. and inundated dense vine tangles are also used by <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> (Shanee <em>et al</em>. 2015; Aquino and Encarnación 1986a,b; Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Tahuayo River (Peru), <em>A. nancymaae</em> had 21.4% of its sleeping sites in the shrub stratum of the understory, 64.3% in the lower story and 14.3% in the middle story. No sleeping sites were found in the upper story or in emergent trees for this species (Aquino and Encarnación 1986a).<br/><br/>Night monkeys are generally nocturnal: they are most active at dawn and dusk.

Trapping permits for malaria research are granted by the regional environmental authority, Corpoamazonia, to the biomedical facility FIDIC, in Leticia, Colombia. SINCHI (the Research Institute for the Colombian Amazon) and the Genetics Laboratory of the Colombian National University – IGUN-UNAL - (CITES Scientific Authorities) conducted a pilot project to gather baseline information on the genetics and ecology of <em>Aotus</em> spp. where the FIDIC had been trapping and releasing animals.

123797627,121097935,Pongo abelii,Critically Endangered,A4bcd,2017,2017-10-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to high levels of habitat conversion and fragmentation, and illegal killing, <em>Pongo abelii</em> is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in recent years. Forest loss data indicate that key Sumatran Orangutan forest habitat (i.e., below 500 m asl) was reduced by 60% of its area between 1985 and 2007 (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011). It is thought that this reduction will continue as forests within the species’ range remain under considerable threat (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016). When relative stability returned to Aceh in 2005 after several years of civil conflict, pressure on natural habitats increased dramatically (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2011). Significant areas of the Orangutan’s range are seriously threatened by logging, mining concessions and agricultural plantations, while new roads are continuously being cut through the habitat. Even in formally protected areas, Orangutans remain under threat from forest conversion to plantations, illegal settlement and encroachment (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2016). Furthermore, an illegal spatial land-use plan being implemented by the Government of Aceh Province ignores the Leuser Ecosystem’s status as a 'National Strategic Area', designated for its environmental function.&#160;Moreover, modelling based on different land-use scenarios and their likely impacts predicts that approximately an additional 4,000 Sumatran Orangutans could be lost by 2030 as a direct consequence of this spatial plan and related developments, and that in 2060 there could be a 81% decline of the population compared to the population in 1985 (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2016, Nowak unpublished data).&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>Due to their slow life history, with a generation time of at least 25 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009), Sumatran Orangutan populations are unable to sustain substantial and continual loss of individuals. If the rate of decline observed since 1985 and predicted continues unabated, the population decline will exceed 80% over a three-generation period (i.e., 75 years from 1985 to 2060), hence qualifying <em>Pongo abelii</em> as Critically Endangered under criterion A4.","Sumatran Orangutans inhabit moist lowland forest, montane forest and peat swamps. They are diurnal and almost exclusively arboreal; females virtually never travel on the ground and adult males do so only rarely. This contrasts somewhat with Bornean Orangutans (especially adult males), which descend and travel on the ground more often (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2014). While both species depend on high-quality primary forests, Bornean Orangutans appear better able to tolerate limited habitat disturbance (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Sumatra, densities plummet by up to 60%, even if logging is highly selective (see Rao and van Schaik 1997) and Orangutan behavioural ecology differs in primary and logged forests (Hardus <em>et al</em>. 2012a).<br/><br/>Sumatran Orangutans are primarily frugivores, but also eat young and mature leaves, seeds, shoots, pith, flowers, insects (termites and ants), bark and, on occasion, the meat of slow loris (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2004, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morrogh-Bernard <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hardus <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Female home ranges vary in size from 0.8–1.5 km². The true extent of male home range size is not fully known, although ranges well in excess of 30 km² are inferred (Singleton and van Schaik 2001, Singleton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Females first give birth at about 15 years of age (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009). Sumatran Orangutans have the longest interbirth intervals of any mammalian species, ranging from 8.2 to 9.3 years (compared with 6.1 to 7.7 years for <em>P. pygmaeus</em>; Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009, van Noordwijk and van Schaik 2005). Gestation lasts approximately 254 days (Kingsley 1981). Infants are weaned at <em>ca </em>7 years. On average, a female bears 4–5 offspring during her lifetime. Males mature at about about 14 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004). They exhibit bimaturism, whereby fully flanged adult males and smaller unflanged males are both capable of reproducing, but employ differing mating strategies (Utami <em>et al</em>. 2002, Utami Atmoko <em>et al</em>. 2009). Longevity in the wild has been estimated at 53 years for females and 58 years for males (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004). Generation length is at least 25 years (Wich <em>et </em>al. 2004, 2009).","The Sumatran Orangutan's survival is seriously threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2016). Forests continue to be cleared at the large and medium scale for oil-palm plantations that can each cover hundreds of square kilometres. On a smaller scale, logging for timber (both legal and illegal) remains a threat, as does the creation of new roads, which fragment populations and gives access to illegal settlements and further encroachment for agriculture and plantations (also frequently illegal), and to wildlife poachers. When industrial plantations are established, the resident orangutans are forced to seek refuge in adjacent forest patches, if any remain, but in the long term they are likely to succumb to malnutrition and starvation due to competition and limited resources. Such forest fragments are often subsequently cleared as well.<br/><br/>Sumatran Orangutans are frequently killed deliberately, completely illegally, and surviving infants end up in an illegal pet trade. This trade tends to be a by-product of habitat conversion, for example, if an Orangutan is found in an isolated patch of trees during the conversion process, there is a high probability it will be killed. Sumatran Orangutans are also regularly killed in human-wildlife conflict situations, for example, if raiding fruit crops on farmland at the forest edge&#160;(Wich <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/>  <br/>By far the largest single current threat to the Sumatran Orangutan comes from a spatial land-use plan ratified by the government of Aceh Province in 2013. Conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem being obligated by Aceh’s own special autonomy law (Law No 11 2006) due to its designation in 2007/8 as a National Strategic Area for its environmental function (which requires its inclusion and special consideration at all levels of spatial planning). But alarmingly the current Aceh spatial plan completely ignores the Leuser Ecosystem’s existence. Both the provincial and national governments have publicly acknowledged the illegality of the Aceh spatial plan, but to date it remains officially ratified at the provincial level and has not been formally cancelled by the national government. As of early 2016, legal challenges are attempting to rectify this situation and to have the current Aceh spatial plan replaced with one that complies fully with all relevant laws, is based on sound environmental sensitivity analyses, and affords appropriate protection to the Leuser Ecosystem in accordance with existing legislation. However, whilst the status quo persists, the Aceh Provincial Spatial Plan of 2013 allows huge tracts of Sumatran Orangutan habitat to be designated for new plantations, and timber and mining concessions, and will lead to many more Sumatran Orangutans being lost in the ensuing years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016). The existing plan also effectively legitimizes numerous roads cut illegally through the forest, which further fragment Orangutan populations and provide yet more access to hunting and encroachment.","The most recent population estimate for the Sumatran Orangutan is 13,846 individuals, in a total area of 16,775 km² of forest (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2016). Excluding populations of fewer than 250 individuals (i.e., considering only populations that are potentially viable over the long term) leaves just 13,587 individuals. The vast majority (i.e., 95.0%) occur in the Leuser Ecosystem, while other populations are found in the Sidiangkat and Pakpak.&#160;The 2016 estimate is higher than the previous estimate of around 6,600 individuals remaining (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008), as it takes into account three factors: a) orangutans were found in greater numbers at higher altitudes than previously supposed (i.e., up to 1,500 m asl not just to 1,000 m asl), b) they were found to be more widely distributed in selectively-logged forests than previously assumed, and c) orangutans were found in some previously unsurveyed forest patches. The new estimate does not, therefore, reflect a real increase in Sumatran Orangutan numbers. On the contrary, it reflects only much improved survey techniques and coverage, and hence more accurate data. It is extremely important to note, therefore, that overall numbers continue to decline dramatically.<br/><br/>Since Sumatran Orangutans have been found up to 1,500 m asl in many areas, there is probably better connectivity among subpopulations in the mountainous Leuser Ecosystem than was previously considered the case (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008). Nevertheless, recent studies found genetic differentiation between subpopulations that is at least partially due to geographic barriers, such as rivers and high mountain ridges, even within the Leuser Ecosystem (Nater <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In addition to the wild populations, two entirely new Sumatran Orangutan populations are gradually being established via the reintroduction of confiscated illegal pets; one in and around the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park (Jambi and Riau provinces) and one in and around the Jantho Pine Forest Nature Reserve, in the far north of Aceh. To date, more than 260 individuals have been reintroduced. The goal of these efforts is to eventually establish new, genetically-viable, fully-reproducing and self-sustaining wild populations as a safety net against catastrophe elsewhere in the species’ range.<br/><br/>About 35.6% of the Sumatran Orangutan population is in protected areas (World Database Protected Areas recognized areas, i.e. excluding hutan lindung/protection forest; SOCP unpublished data), followed by 40.0% in hutan lindung/protection forest, 3.6% in limited production forest, 11.8% in production forest, and 8.9% in other use forest. Including the whole Leuser Ecosystem, which is on the list of Indonesia’s WDPAs: 98.5% of all Sumatran Orangutans are in PAs (incl. hutan lindung/protection forest) or 95.5% in all WDPA recognized areas (thus excluding hutan lindung/protection forest).",Decreasing,"<em>Pongo abelii</em>&#160;is endemic to the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is restricted to the north of the island, with its southern limit being the Simpang Kanan River and tributaries on the west coast and the Asahan River on the east coast, and its northern limit coinciding primarily with the northern boundary of the Leuser Ecosystem in Aceh Province (Wich <em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"">et al</em>. 2003, 2008, 2016).<br/><br/>Today the majority of Sumatran Orangutans (82.5%) are found in Aceh Province at the northernmost tip of the island. There are populations in North Sumatra Province but the largest of these, in the southern and eastern regions of the Leuser Ecosystem, straddles the border with Aceh. Despite a few smaller patches of forest south of the Leuser Ecosystem appearing to still host orangutan populations, only one entirely North Sumatran population is considered viable in the long term, namely the Pakpak Barat population (for precise locations, see Wich <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2016).<br/><br/>Sumatran Orangutan densities decline with increasing altitude and few, if any, reproducing populations are thought to reside in forests above 1,500 m asl (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016).","It is illegal to capture, injure, kill, own, keep, transport, or trade a Sumatran Orangutan.",Terrestrial,"<em>Pongo abelii</em> is strictly protected by Indonesian National Law No. 5/1990 on the Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystems, under which it is illegal to capture, injure, kill, own, keep, transport, or trade a Sumatran Orangutan.

The species’ major stronghold is the Leuser Ecosystem – an area of 26,000 km² mostly contiguous forest that supports <em>circa</em>&#160;95.0% of the Sumatran Orangutans remaining in the wild. Conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem was called for under Indonesian National Law No. 11/2006 concerning Governance in Aceh, and it was inaugurated by Presidential Decree in 1998. Designated a National Strategic Area for its environmental function, the Leuser Ecosystem must be fully recognized and its integrity ensured at all levels of spatial land-use planning.

123809220,17975,Pongo pygmaeus,Critically Endangered,A4abcd,2016,2016-02-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Bornean Orangutans are lowland forest specialists, rarely found above 500 m asl. In the 1950s, the habitat suitable for orangutans extended across ~255,000&#160;km²&#160;of the island of Borneo (see below).<br/><br/>The two major reasons why most Bornean Orangutans populations are in sharp decline are (1) destruction, degradation and fragmentation of their habitats, and (2) hunting. Recurrent forest fires, especially in peat forests, cause additional sharp declines about once every decade. Bornean Orangutans decreased by more than 60% between 1950 and 2010, and a further 22% decline is projected to occur between 2010 and 2025 (see below). Combined, this equates to a loss of more than 82% over 75 years, 1950–2025. Given that a Bornean Orangutan's generation length is ~25 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2009), this decline will occur in a period of three generations. Each of the <em>Pongo pygmaeus</em> subspecies is roughly equally affected. Only one comprehensive quantitative survey of Bornean Orangutans has been conducted, in 2010, which prohibits quantitative assessment of changes in numbers for most populations. Temporal changes in population status are therefore best assessed via the proxies of habitat loss and hunting rates. A detailed rationale for a population decline of more than 86% between 1950 and 2025 follows.<br/><br/>The most accurate estimate of the geographic range of Bornean Orangutans showed that in 2010, 59.6% of the forest remaining in Borneo was suitable habitat (155,106&#160;km²&#160;of 260,109&#160;km²&#160;of forest: Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012, Gaveau <em>et al.</em> 2014). Considering that in 1973, 75.7% of Borneo (424,753&#160;km²) was under natural forest (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014), we estimate that 253,153&#160;km²&#160;of forest was orangutan habitat at this time.<br/><br/>Mechanized logging in Borneo started in the early 1950s, and industrial logging and forest conversion intensified in the late 1960s. The rate of forest conversion is difficult to estimate prior to 1973 due to the lack of satellite imagery, but a recent spatial analysis evaluated forest persistence, clearance and logging spanning the 37 years between 1973 and 2010 (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). We take the rate of forest loss documented from 1973 to 2010 as conservative and <em>de facto</em> lower than if data were available from 1950.<br/><br/><strong>1. Habitat loss and orangutan decline<br/></strong>During the period 1973–2010, 39% of Bornean forests were lost (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014), representing a net loss of 98,730&#160;km²&#160;of prime orangutan habitat. It is estimated that a further 37% of suitable orangutan habitat (155,106&#160;km²) will be converted to plantations between 2010 and 2025, which accounts for the loss of an additional 57,140&#160;km²&#160;of orangutan habitat (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). Compared to the baseline (253,153&#160;km²), more than 155,867&#160;km²&#160;or of 61.5% of orangutan habitat will be gone by 2025; see Table 1 in Supplementary Material.<br/><br/>The orangutan habitat remaining in 2010 (97,716&#160;km²) was either protected or designated for timber production (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). Nonetheless, forest loss is expected to occur here too, owing to fires, encroachment and smallholder plantation development. Rates of forest loss measured at two sites with the largest Borneo orangutan populations are: 1.9% per year (1991–2000) and 1.5% per year (2000–2007) at Sebangau National Park (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2015); and 2.4% per year including the buffer zone, or 1.1% excluding the buffer zone (1988–2002) at Gunung Palung National Park (Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004). The rate of loss in production forests outside formally protected areas will undoubtedly be&#160;higher (Santika <em>et al</em>. 2015). Thus we conservatively estimate the ongoing rate of loss in this administrative type of forest to be 1.5% per year. This will represent another 19,821&#160;km²&#160;of forest lost between 2010 and 2025: 20.2% of the orangutan habitat in 2010, or 8.7% in 1973.<br/><br/><strong>2. Habitat degradation and orangutan decline<br/></strong>In addition to habitat loss, selective logging has degraded 56% of Bornean Orangutan habitat since 1973 (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). The impacts of logging on orangutan density are variable, from little change in lightly-logged forest to major negative impacts in heavily-logged forest (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2010). For example, selective&#160;artisanal&#160;logging reduced orangutan densities in peat-swamp forests by 21–30% (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2009), while mechanised logging in dryland forests is presumed to have a greater impact. Thus, 56% of the&#160;Bornean Orangutan&#160;range could undergo a&#160;20%&#160;decrease in carrying capacity. This estimate is conservative, considering that in Kalimantan the total area of natural forest allocated for timber extraction is increasing. Reduction in carrying capacity due to logging would then equate to a loss of 7% of the 1973 population by 2010, and overall accounts for 4% of the total projected 1973–2025 population decline.<br/><br/><strong>3. Hunting and orangutan decline<br/></strong>The widespread impacts of illegal hunting had not been quantified prior to a major questionnaire study throughout Kalimantan in 2008–2009 (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2011). The authors estimated that 630–1,357 Bornean Orangutans were killed in 2008 and that an average of 2,383–3,882 per year had been killed during the lifetimes of the survey respondents. The mean estimate (2,256 orangutans poached in Kalimantan each year) equates to 2.6% of the 2010 population for Kalimantan. Population losses due to hunting may be partially offset by population growth, which has a maximum theoretical rate of 2% annually (Marshall <em>et al</em>, 2009). The only study to have measured growth in a Bornean Orangutan population was carried out in Sebangau National Park in a population recovering from a logging-induced crash. Here, growth was relatively uninhibited and estimated to increase at an average annual rate of 1.6% between 2001 and 2013 (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is highly unlikely that a continuously-hunted population could recover at this rate, but in order to take into account uncertainties in determining the level of hunting, a 1.5% growth rate is applied, resulting in a net population decrease due to hunting of 1.1% annually. This equates to an additional loss (once habitat clearance and impacts of logging are factored in) of 18% of the 1973 population by 2010 and 7% of the 2010 population by 2025. Overall, poaching contributes 12% to the estimated 1973–2025 population decrease.<br/><br/>The combined impacts of habitat loss, habitat degradation and illegal hunting equate to an 86% population reduction between 1973 and 2025 which qualifies the species for listing as Critically Endangered. This estimate is relatively conservative, as it does not include additional future population losses anticipated due to stochastic effects that will reduce populations inhabiting increasingly small forest fragments.<br/><br/>Orangutan habitat loss and killing were already significant threats during the period 1950–1973, and the species was already declining at this time. However the paucity of data for this period prevents to estimate a specific rate of population decline for this specific period of time. However, if we assume that orangutan abundance in 1950 was similar to that in 1973 (which is not the case because any declines that occurred between 1950 and 1973 are not accounted for), our analysis shows that the species will suffer a more than 80% decline in three generations (1950–2025).</p>","<p>Bornean Orangutans are the largest arboreal mammals in the world, although they walk significant distances on the ground (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2014). Historically,&#160;Bornean Orangutans were most abundant in inundated and semi-inundated lowland Dipterocarp mosaic forests, where movement between different habitat types could buffer them against shortages in food availability in a particular habitat type. Their diet consists primarily of fruits, but also includes leaves, barks, flowers and insects (Russon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Bornean Orangutans&#160;live a semi-solitary life and rarely aggregate in groups. Males are the dispersing sex: upon reaching sexual maturity (at 10–12 years old), they leave the area where they were born to establish large territories covering several hundred hectares. Females’ territories are smaller, with actual size depending on forest type and availability of food resources. Bornean Orangutans are very slow breeders and produce on average one offspring every 6–8 years, which explains their extreme sensitivity to hunting pressure. Females reach maturity at 10–15 years old; they generally give birth to a single infant after a gestation period of approximately 254 days (Kingsley 1981).</p>","Major threats include:<strong><br/></strong><ol><li><strong>Habitat loss</strong>. Between 2000 and 2010, the mean annual rate of&#160;deforestation&#160;for Borneo was 3,234&#160;km²&#160;per year (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). Assuming a similar deforestation rate in the future, 32,000                  km²&#160;of forest could be lost by 2020; 129,000                  km²&#160;by 2050 and 226,000                  km²&#160;by 2080 (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the early 2010s, only 22% of the current Bornean Orangutan distribution was located in protected areas (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). Approximately a third of the entire&#160;Bornean Orangutan&#160;range was in commercial forest reserves exploited for timber, and about 45% was in forest areas earmarked for conversion to agriculture or other land uses. A business-as-usual scenario, whereby non-protected forests would be converted along the lines of current development plans, will result in the loss of more than half of the current orangutan range on the island of Borneo in the next 50 years or so.</li><li><strong>Illegal h</strong><strong>unting</strong>. Illegal killing of Bornean Orangutans is a major cause of their decline. Recent interview surveys conducted in Kalimantan revealed that several thousand individuals are killed every year for meat consumption, as a way to mitigate conflict, or for other reasons (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2013). Overall&#160;Bornean Orangutan&#160;mortality rates in Kalimantan seem to significantly exceed the maximum rates that populations of this slow-breeding species can sustain (Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009, Meijaard&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). If hunting does not stop, all populations that are&#160;hunted&#160;will decline, irrespective of what happens to their habitat. These findings confirm that habitat protection alone will not ensure the survival of orangutans in Indonesian Borneo, and that effective reduction of orangutan killings is urgently needed.</li><li><strong>Fires</strong>.&#160;Fires occur in Borneo on a yearly basis and are responsible for significant forest loss with dramatic results for certain orangutan populations. For example, 90% of Kutai National Park was lost to massive fires in 1983 and 1998 and its&#160;Bornean Orangutan&#160;population was reduced from an estimated 4,000 individuals in the 1970s to a mere 600 (Rijksen and Meijaard 1999); over 4,000                  km²&#160;of peatland forest in southern Kalimantan was burnt to ashes in six months of 1997–1998, resulting in an estimated loss of 8,000 orangutans. In 2015, more than 20,000                  km²&#160;of forest were lost to fires, which resulted in hundreds (or more) of additional orangutan deaths.</li><li><strong>Habitat fragmentation</strong>. With the current scale of habitat exploitation and forest conversion to other types of land uses in Borneo, only a small percentage of current orangutan habitat will remain undisturbed by infrastructure development by 2030 (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2013). Several orangutan PHVAs have shown that Bornean Orangutan populations of fewer than 50 individuals are not viable in the long term (Marshall<em> <em>et al</em></em>. 2009), and that many small populations will go extinct unless they are actively managed (Bruford <em>et al</em>. 2010).</li><li><strong>Lack of awareness</strong>.&#160;A recent study suggested that 27% of the people in Kalimantan did not know that orangutans are protected by law (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2011). Campaigns to effectively inform the public and encourage rural people to support the principles of environmental conservation and be actively responsible for the management of their resources are therefore a crucial requirement for successful orangutan conservation.</li><li><strong>Climate change</strong>. Spatial models point to the possibility that a large amount of current orangutan habitat will become unsuitable because of changes in climate (Struebig <em>et al</em>. 2015). Across all climate and land-cover change projections assessed in a recent analysis, models predicted that 49,000–83,000                  km²&#160;of orangutan habitat will remain by 2080, reflecting a loss of 69–81% since 2010. This projection represents a three to five-fold greater decline in habitat than that predicted by deforestation projections alone.&#160;A major reduction in the extent of suitable orangutan habitat can be expected. However, core strongholds of suitable orangutan habitat are predicted to remain to the west, east and northeast of the island where populations of <em>P. p. wurmbii</em> and <em>P. p. morio</em> are found.</li></ol>","<p>Climatic change and human pressure have resulted in significant reductions in the range and numbers of Bornean Orangutans during the recent historic past (Goossens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Meijaard&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The total number of orangutans in Borneo is not precisely known, except for Sabah, where comprehensive aerial surveys in the early 2000s provided an estimate of 11,000 individuals for the entire State (Ancrenaz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). The most recent (2004) estimate for the species is that <em>c.</em> 55,000&#160;Bornean Orangutans inhabit 82,000&#160;km²&#160;of forest (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, using modelling and the latest field data available for Borneo, a revised map of their current distribution gives a larger range estimate of 155,000&#160;km², or 21% of Borneo’s landmass (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). If the mean average orangutan density recorded in 2004 (0.67 individuals/km²) is applied to the updated geographic range, then the total population estimate would be 104,700 individuals.&#160;This represents a decline from an estimated 288,500 individuals in 1973 and is projected to decline further to 47,000 individuals by 2025.<br/><br/>Compounding loss of habitat, recent interview surveys in Kalimantan have concluded that 2,000–3,000 orangutans were killed every year in Indonesian Borneo during the past four decades alone (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2011). This would represent a loss of 44,170–66,570 individuals (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2013), or more than 50% of the original population in just 40 years. Such a rate of killings is unsustainable (Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009) and many populations will be reduced or become extinct in the next 50 years (Abram <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"The Bornean Orangutan is endemic to the island of Borneo where it is present in both the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, as well as in&#160;four of the five Indonesian Provinces of Kalimantan: North, East,&#160;Central and&#160;West&#160;Kalimantan.&#160;The distribution of Bornean Orangutans is highly patchy throughout the island; they are apparently absent or uncommon in the southeast, the forests between the Rejang River in central Sarawak, and the Padas River in western Sabah (including the Sultanate of Brunei).&#160;The Bornean Orangutan occurs preferentially in lowland forests below 500 m asl, but some individuals can also be found in highland habitats, for example, up to 1,500 m asl in Kinabalu National Park. Large rivers are natural barriers that are impassable to these animals and limit their dispersal (Goossens <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2005).","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Bornean Orangutan is fully protected in Malaysia and Indonesia, and is listed on Appendix I of CITES.&#160;However, its forest habitat is not necessarily protected: about 20% of the current orangutan range in Sabah, and 80% in Kalimantan is not protected (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). Innovative mechanisms to ensure the long-term survival of Bornean Orangutans outside protected forests are urgently needed.<br/><br/>The future of&#160;Bornean Orangutans&#160;will very much depend on the long-term security of large, strictly-protected forests where illegal logging and hunting will be efficiently controlled and the orangutan populations large enough to cope with catastrophic events such as fires and disease outbreaks (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2011). These forests need to contain the ecological gradients that will provide the&#160;key resources to sustain orangutans through climate and other gradual environmental changes (Gregory <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the larger landscape, scientifically-based, regional land-use planning is needed to delineate zones of interaction around protected forests and their surroundings, encompassing hydrological, ecological and socio-economic interactions. Ideally, the core protected areas will remain connected to other areas of forest that could be used sustainably for (commercial) timber extraction. The design of such living landscapes must be approached across the whole landscape rather than at the site level.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
124646285,70609849,Pithecia inusta,Least Concern,,2018,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern due to its wide range. There is little information on this species. It is undoubtedly hunted, but is quite wide ranging in Amazonian Peru and the western Amazon in Brazil.","All <em>Pithecia </em>species tend to prefer mature forest that includes variations of flooded forest—várzea (white-water flooded forest) and igapó (black-water flooded forest)—palm swamp (Mauritia swamp for some) and terra firma forest. They can be found in disturbed habitats and in fragments with secondary forest, but as seed predators of large forest tree species (notably of the family Lecythidaceae), they tend to be in higher densities in mature forest. One possible explanation for their very large geographic distribution as a genus and as individual species is their ability to use a range of forest types, from várzea to igapó to terra firma (c.f., Marsh 2014).&#160; &#160;<br/>Sakis are the smallest of the pitheciines, but are larger than other non-prehensile-tailed platyrrhines (<em>Aotus</em>, <em>Saimiri</em>, <em>Callicebus </em>and the Callitrichinae). Adults weigh in at 1.5–4.0 kg, with a wide range in total body length (250–980 mm) and tail length (255–545 mm) reflecting the diversity among the taxa. Their tails are often 1:1 with the body length, but in many species tails are longer by &gt;100 mm (based on museum specimen data) for both males and females. Size dimorphism is not striking but, depending on the species, females tend to be smaller in weight and overall size. Sakis are characterised by their long, coarse, fluffy hair that easily piloerects when they are approached in the wild, making them look bigger than they actually are. The hair on the tail tends to be longer than on the back, but this varies among species, and the tail hair also “puffs up” as a threat. Hair on the trunk is always longer than that on the forearms and hind limbs, and underbellies are very lightly covered or bare. Coronal hairs are directed forward as a hood, and, depending on the species, overlap the facial region making them appear to have “bangs.” Both males and females have distinct throat glands for scent marking, with varying development depending on the species; some males have obvious neck folds and others only a bare skin patch. Sakis are frugivore/seed predators, but they eat insects such as army ants, as well as spiders, and other arthropods. They vocalize in grunts, chirps, whistles, and low calls, but can be exceptionally quiet when sneaking away from a perceived threat such as a field researcher. Sakis are specialized morphologically for seed predation. The diet is made up of seeds, fruit pulp, young leaves, insects and flowers.&#160;&#160;<br/>Movement Patterns: Locomotion consists of quadrupedal walking/ running, climbing and leaping. Members of this genus form small groups (2-9 individuals) which in some species may resemble a loose “fission-fusion” (Marsh, pers. obs) but core groups generally comprise a single male-female breeding pair and several young. Day ranges (1.5-2 km), home ranges are small (10-25 km) and sakis exhibit behaviours associated with territory defense (c.f., Marsh 2014).Congregatory: Somewhat. Amazonian sakis are frequently seen in association (traveling, feeding and resting) with other primates such as <em>Callicebus</em>, <em>Alouatta</em>, <em>Ateles</em>, <em>Saimri</em>, <em>Saguinus</em>, <em>Lagothrix </em>(Marsh, pers. obs).",The main threat is hunting and habitat loss.

129038584,15933,Pan troglodytes,Endangered,A4bcde,2016,2016-03-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Although&#160;<em>Pan troglodytes</em>&#160;is the most abundant and widespread of the great apes, and many populations exist in protected areas, the declines that have occurred are expected to continue, satisfying the criteria for an Endangered listing (Oates 2006). Due to high levels of poaching, infectious diseases, and loss of habitat and habitat quality caused by expanding human activities, this species is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in the past 20–30 years and it is suspected that this reduction will continue for the next 30–40 years. Due to their slow life history and a generation time estimated to be 25 years, Chimpanzee populations cannot sustain high levels of mortality, whether disease-induced or caused by poaching. The maximum population reduction over a three-generation (75 year) period from 1975 to 2050 is suspected to exceed 50%, hence qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A. Although conservation efforts directed at Chimpanzees and other wildlife have increased significantly in recent years, the assumption that population reductions will continue is a precautionary approach based on the rapid growth of human populations in sub-Saharan Africa, continuing poaching for bushmeat, the commercial bushmeat trade, the arrival of industrial agriculture (which requires clearcutting of forest), corruption and lack of law enforcement, lack of capacity and resources, and political instability in some range states. At the same time, zoonosis and disease outbreaks present significant risks; there is, for example, evidence that <em>Ebolavirus</em> will continue to spread&#160;in some parts of the Chimpanzee's geographic range&#160;(Walsh <em>et al.</em> 2005).</p><p>For more information, see the four <em>Pan troglodytes</em> subspecies accounts.</p>","<p>Chimpanzees are found discontinuously across the forest belt of Africa, occupying primary and secondary moist lowland forest, swamp forest, submontane and montane forest, dry forest, forest galleries in savanna woodland, and farmland (Oates 2011). In West Africa, Chimpanzees are also found in fallow-agricultural matrixes dominated by wild or feral oil palm (Leciak <em>et al.</em> 2005, Brncic <em>et al.</em> 2010, Sousa <em>et al</em>. 2011). They live in multimale-multifemale, fission-fusion communities averaging 35 members. The largest known community has c.150 members (Mitani and Watts 2005). Annual home ranges are smaller in mixed forest than in woodland forest mosaics: one of the smallest known is 6 km² at Budongo in Uganda (Newton-Fisher 2003), while one of the largest is 72 km² at Semliki, also in Uganda (Samson and Hunt 2012). Chimpanzees are omnivorous and opportunistic feeders. Fruit forms about half the diet, typically supplemented with terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, leaves, stems, seeds, flowers, bark, pith, honey, mushrooms, resin, eggs, and animal prey such as insects and medium-sized mammals. They are the most carnivorous of the great apes. Chimpanzees are also proficient tool users. Tools made from plant parts are used to extract bees, ants and termites from their nests (e.g., Fowler and Sommer 2007), and stone and wooden hammers are used to crack nuts (e.g., Boesch and Boesch 1984, Matsuzawa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p>Life History (as summarised in Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013): Male and female Chimpanzees reach puberty at 7–8 years of age. Females have a 35-day reproductive cycle. The first parturition is generally at 13–14 years of age, but as early as 9–10 years in one population of western Chimpanzees. Chimpanzees reproduce throughout the year. Gestation is c.230 days. The norm is a single infant, but occasionally twins are born. Offspring are&#160;typically&#160;weaned at 4–5 years of age. The interbirth interval averages 4.6–7.2 years when the preceding infant survives. Females can remain reproductive into their late forties. Maximum life span is unknown, but thought to be <em>ca</em> 50 years. Female Chimpanzees may give birth to as many as nine offspring during their lifetime, but only one third of them survive beyond infancy. Generation time is estimated to be 25 years (Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>","<p>The four Chimpanzee subspecies face similar threats, but to varying degrees in different regions. The major threats to <em>Pan troglodytes </em>are:</p><p><strong>1. Poaching</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, poaching is the greatest threat to most Chimpanzees. Due to their low population densities and slow reproductive rates, hunting often leads to the local extirpation of Chimpanzee populations. Increases in human populations, the ease of obtaining guns and ammunition, transport system efficiency, and high financial incentives for supplying urban markets with bushmeat and other forest commodities have resulted in swathes of land in the forest zone of Africa being cleared of wildlife. Chimpanzees are generally hunted opportunistically, but are sometimes targeted because they provide more meat than smaller mammals, such as duikers. Throughout the African moist forest region, poaching is intense around resources extraction camps – especially industrial and artisanal mining sites and logging camps – where bushmeat is usually the main source of protein available. Hunting with guns (targeting individuals) and snaring (an indiscriminate method of trapping) are the most common ways that Chimpanzees are killed. The widespread use of wire snares across Africa means that Chimpanzees can be caught and killed (or maimed) in snares set for other terrestrial mammals (e.g., Quiatt <em>et al</em>. 2002).</p><p>When Chimpanzees are killed for meat, their infants sometimes become pets, and some are trafficked (e.g., Hicks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although all trade in Chimpanzees and their body parts is illegal, a small but pernicious and clandestine trade persists is some parts of Africa (e.g., CITES Secretariat 2014). Chimpanzees are sometimes killed intentionally–even poisoned–by people protecting their crops or as retribution for crop raiding (e.g., Brncic <em>et al.</em> 2010). Such trends are likely to increase as more natural habitat is converted to agricultural fields or plantations. Instances of crop foraging and encounters between people and Chimpanzees are becoming more frequent, especially in West Africa. This exacerbates negative perceptions and aggravates people’s attitudes towards Chimpanzees, thus potentially intensifying rates of killing, and subsequently fuelling the live trade with orphaned infants. Close to one thousand confiscated chimpanzees are now housed in sanctuaries in their range countries.</p><p>Until the mid-1990s, much of Central Africa was a series of vast, roadless forest blocks, to which access was extremely difficult and where human population density was very low. In the last quarter of a century, however, almost all <em>terra firma</em> forest in the non-protected areas of the central Chimpanzee’s range has been assigned as logging concessions (Global Forest Watch 2016). This means that most of the once-remote, previously inaccessible forests are now covered by a network of logging roads (Laporte <em>et al.</em> 2007), which provides rapid access to hunters entering the forest and to traffickers taking consignments of bushmeat out of the forest to distant destinations – often towns and cities where bushmeat fetches the highest prices. In recent years, extractive industries have stimulated very high rates of human immigration and the creation of yet more access roads, which are also used for poaching (e.g., Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p><strong>2. Habitat loss and degradation</strong></p><p>(a) Subsistence/slash-and-burn agriculture: the conversion of forest to farmland across Africa has severely reduced the availability of Chimpanzee habitat. Such habitat loss is especially acute in West Africa, where it is estimated that more than 80% of the region’s original forest cover had been lost by the early 2000s (Kormos <em>et al</em>. 2003). Extensive land conversion in eastern DRC, western Rwanda and western Uganda has destroyed much of the sub-montane forest used by Chimpanzees. In Central Africa, annual rates of loss are lower, averaging about 0.14% (2000–2010 data; Desclée <em>et al</em>. 2014). Ongoing rapid growth in human populations is expected to lead to further widespread conversion of forest and woodland to agricultural land. Along the northern border of the forest-savanna boundary at about 6°N, forests are also being lost to fires and grazing of livestock.</p><p>(b) Extractive industries – logging, mining and oil: logging generally has a negative impact on Chimpanzee densities due to habitat alteration (principally removal of important food trees) and disturbance (Morgan <em>et al. </em>2007). As timber concessions undergo repeated cycles of logging, degradation over time will lead to profound changes in forest composition (Zimmerman and Kormos 2012), as the mature trees of certain species–some of high importance to Chimpanzees for food–are logged out. Mining of precious metals and mineral ores, and drilling for oil not only devastate wildlife habitat, but typically also lead to human inmigration and the building of roads, railways and other infrastructure. As with logging, the resulting increased accessibility to remote areas exacerbates risks to Chimpanzees through habitat degradation and fragmentation in areas not previously impacted by such anthropogenic pressures. The creation of open-pit mines leads to irretrievable loss of forest (Lanjouw 2014).</p><p>(c) Industrial agriculture – as tropical Asia nears its capacity for oil-palm plantations, Africa has become the new frontier for this crop, which offers excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperature conditions (Rival and Lavang 2014). Unfortunately, these areas coincide with good great ape habitat: 42.3% of the African apes’ range is suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2014), so the spread of plantations is likely to hit Chimpanzee populations hard in coming years. This situation is of special concern for Chimpanzees living outside protected areas. Changes caused by the rapid transformation of their habitat can have profound impacts on their diet, activity patterns, dispersal and ranging patterns, as well as introducing new pathogens and other risks linked to close proximity with people (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>(d) Major transportation infrastructure – huge road projects, which can be several kilometres wide, are currently underway across Africa and these will substantially fragment great ape habitat and add further to the area of “lost forest” (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). This phenomenon is not confined to the African continent (Laurance <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p><p><strong>3. Disease</strong></p><p>The second major driver of decline in central Chimpanzee populations is infectious disease, especially Ebola virus disease (EVD). Surveys carried out from the 1980s to the present day indicate that EVD caused a series of massive great ape die-offs in a large, mostly-intact forested area straddling the border between northeastern Gabon and northwestern Congo, which includes several national parks and logging concessions (Walsh <em>et al.</em> 2003, Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2004, 2013). Since the early 1990s, about 14% of their total area of distribution has been affected by Ebola virus (<em>Ebolavirus</em>). The virus is still present in the region’s forests: thus, as large areas can be affected by each outbreak, and transmission between individuals is rapid (Walsh et al 2007, 2009), large numbers of central Chimpanzees could succumb to this deadly virus within a span of weeks or months. Although both the Sangha and the Ngoko rivers are barriers to great ape movements (Anthony <em>et al.</em> 2007, Fünfstück <em>et al.</em> 2014), <em>Ebolavirus</em> can cross rivers and has already been detected to the east of the major river barrier between Odzala-Kokoua National Park and the Sangha River (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2014), thus a future outbreak in this region is a strong possibility. There is no evidence to date that the recent dramatic Ebola epidemic in West Africa has affected Chimpanzees, although Ebola killed Chimpanzees in Côte d’Ivoire in the mid-1990s (Formenty<em> et al</em>. 1999).</p><p>Because Chimpanzees and humans are so similar, Chimpanzees succumb to many diseases that afflict humans. Infectious diseases, including outbreaks of respiratory disease and anthrax, are the main cause of death in several Chimpanzee populations that have been habituated to human presence (e.g., Goodall 1986, Nishida <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hanamura <em>et al</em>. 2006, Leendertz <em>et al.</em> 2006, Köndgen <em>et al. </em>2008, Humle 2011). If not properly managed, research and tourism present opportunities for disease transmission between humans and Chimpanzees (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>For information on threats specific to each taxon, including climate change impacts, see the four <em>Pan troglodytes</em> subspecies accounts.</p>","<p>Great ape population estimates are made using a standard index of abundance: night nest abundance and distribution, sometimes combined with predictive modelling. In 2003, the total Chimpanzee population size was estimated to be 172,700–299,700 (Butynski 2003). Current estimates for each subspecies are:&#160;</p>  <ul>  <li>probably fewer than 6,000–9,000 <em>P. t. </em><em>ellioti</em> (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2011, J. Oates      pers. comm. 2015)</li>  <li>181,000–256,000 <em>P. t. schweinfurthii</em> (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2010a), including      a large population in northern DRC that was formerly considered to be      outside of the species’ known range (Hicks <em>et al</em>. 2014)</li>  <li>approximately 140,000 <em>P. t. troglodytes</em> (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. in prep.)</li>  <li>18,000–65,000 <em>P. </em><em>t. verus </em>(Sop <em>et al</em>. in prep.)</li></ul>  <p><em>Pan t. ellioti</em> is the least numerous subspecies. One of the largest and probably most secure subpopulations is in Gashaka-Gumti National Park, Nigeria, estimated at 900–1,000 individuals (Ogunjemite <em>et al</em>. 2010, Adanu <em>et al.</em> 2011). Other major subpopulations are found in Cameroon in Banyang-Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary (estimated at 500–900 or 800–1,450 individuals, depending on nest-decay parameters used; Greengrass and Maisels 2007), in the proposed Ebo National Park (estimated at 626–1,480 individuals, M. Ndimbe and B. Morgan pers. comm. 2015), and in Mbam and Djerem National Park (at least 500 individuals, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>  <p>The vast majority of <em>P. t. schweinfurthii</em> are found in DRC (173,000–248,000, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2010a,&#160;2015). Outside the DRC, there are roughly 5,000 in Uganda (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2003a), just over 400 in Rwanda (WCS Rwanda unpubl. data), fewer than 400 in Burundi (Hakizimana and Huynen 2013), and fewer than 2,500 in Tanzania (A. Piel and F. Stewart, pers. comm.). Almost all Chimpanzees in Tanzania are found in the Greater Mahale Ecosystem, and their populations appear to be stable (Piel <em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, Chimpanzee numbers in Rwanda’s Nyungwe National Park are relatively stable (Sop <em>et al</em>. 2015). In western Uganda, forest is being lost at many Chimpanzee sites; however, data from the protected areas (Budongo and Bugoma forest reserves, Kibale National Park) indicate that Chimpanzee populations there are relatively stable (Wanyama <em>et al.</em> 2009, Plumptre <em>et al.</em> 2010b).</p>  <p>The forests of central Africa where <em>Pan t. troglodytes</em> occurs are by far the least disturbed in the species’ range. About one third of the subspecies population resides in Gabon and around 40% in Congo, followed by Cameroon (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The area of forest in these countries is very roughly representative of the proportion of Chimpanzees that it holds. A few thousand individuals remain in Equatorial Guinea, and a few hundred in CAR; the size of the populations in Angola (Cabinda) and DRC is unknown.</p>  <p>The <em>P. </em><em>t. verus</em> strongholds are Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (Ham 1998, Kormos, Humle <em>et al</em>. 2003, Brncic <em>et al.</em> 2010, Tweh <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Chimpanzees are protected by national and international laws throughout their range, but enforcement is generally weak. All four subspecies occur in numerous national parks; however, the majority occur outside protected areas (IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). Even within protected areas, safe haven is not guaranteed: many protected areas in tropical Africa lack adequate management and suffer from poorly-controlled poaching. Stricter enforcement of wildlife laws and more effective management of what may become the last refuges for many great ape populations are needed urgently.</p><p>Conservation needs for Chimpanzees across Africa fall into several broad areas:</p>  <p></p><ol><li>Effective law enforcement, not only in protected areas, but also in logging, mining and agricultural concessions.

Industrial extraction of other natural resources, namely timber and minerals, should be incorporated into a holistic, spatially-explicit approach.

136250858,9404,Gorilla gorilla,Critically Endangered,A4bcde,2018,2016-04-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Gorilla gorilla</em> has a large geographic range, covering over 700,000 km². The size of the population in 2013 was estimated to be almost 362,000 individuals&#160; (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). Only a very small number of Western Gorillas are the <em>G. g. diehli</em> subspecies, therefore this rationale focuses on the <em>G. g. gorilla</em> subspecies. The country of Gabon lost over half its Gorilla population between 1983 and 2000 (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003). More recent population declines have been estimated using a predictive model that incorporated survey data collected between 2003 and 2013 across the entire range of Western Lowland Gorillas. The results reveal an 19.4% decline between 2005 and 2013, corresponding to an annual loss of ~2.7% (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). These population decreases were driven by poaching and disease (<em>Ebolavirus</em>) outbreaks.<br/><br/>Despite their abundance and wide geographic range, Western Gorillas qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion A: a population reduction of more than 80% over three generations (one generation is ~22 years). This listing is based on ongoing population losses due to illegal hunting, disease and habitat loss: poaching is intensifying with the expansion of access routes into forests and Zaire <em>Ebolavirus</em> remains a highly significant threat. At a conservative rate of reduction (2.7% per year rather than 4%, calculated from Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003), the reduction in the Western Gorilla population is predicted to exceed 80% over three generations (i.e., 66 years, 2005–2071). Illegal hunting has not ceased despite intense anti-poaching efforts, and the threat of <em>Ebolavirus</em> has not been removed. In addition, the scale of habitat conversion to industrial agriculture will increase, and the effects of climate change will become more evident. <em>Gorilla gorilla</em> thus qualifies as Critically Endangered (A4bcde).","Western Gorillas are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. They build nests to sleep in every night, usually on the ground but sometimes in trees. They are social and live in stable, cohesive groups composed of one “silverback” adult male, several adult females and their offspring. Gorillas are not territorial and group ranges overlap extensively.<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. diehli</em></strong><br/>Cross River Gorillas inhabit forests largely restricted to rough terrain in remote areas, although they occasionally use lowland areas between hills (Oates <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bergl and Vigilant 2007). This distribution appears to be directly related to greater levels of human activity (especially poaching) in lowland areas, rather than selection of areas that provide preferred foods (Imong <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sawyer and Brashares 2013). Group sizes range from 2 to 20 individuals and home ranges may be as large as 30 km² (McFarland 2007, Sunderland-Groves <em>et al</em>. 2009). The highly-seasonal nature of the Cross River Gorillas’ habitat (more markedly seasonal than that of other Gorilla populations) likely contributes to grouping and ranging patterns. Their diet reflects this seasonality, with terrestrial herbs and bark eaten as staples throughout the year, and fruit consumed during periods of seasonal abundance (McFarland 2007, De Vere <em>et al</em>. 2011, Etiendem and Tagg 2013, Sawyer and Brashares 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. gorilla</em></strong><br/>Western Lowland Gorillas occur in both swamp and <em>terra firma</em> lowland forests throughout Western Equatorial Africa. They are especially common where ground vegetation is dominated by monocotyledonous plants such as <em>Haumania liebrechtsiana</em> and <em>Megaphrynium macrostachyum</em> (Rainey <em>et al</em>. 2009). Staple and fallback foods are pith of <em>Aframomum</em> spp. and leaves and shoots of the Marantaceae family, whereas fruit consumption varies greatly between seasons (Rogers <em>et al</em>. 2004). Some populations spend hours feeding on aquatic herbs in baïs and swamps. Social ants and termites are the only animal matter deliberately ingested. Group size averages 10, but is occasionally over 20 individuals, and annual home ranges are usually 10–25 km² (Williamson and Butynski 2013).<br/><br/>Life History (as summarised in Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013): Male Western Gorillas take 18 years to reach full maturity, and females take <em>ca</em>10 years. Length of the reproductive cycle is unknown. There is no birth season. Mean length of gestation is 256 days in captive Gorillas. Infant mortality up to three years of age is 22–65%. Infants suckle for 4–5 years, causing lactational amenorrhea in the mother. Interbirth intervals are 4–6 years. Western Gorillas appear to reproduce more slowly than Eastern Gorillas (<em>G. beringei</em>). Maximum life span is unknown, but likely to be <em>ca</em> 40 years. Generation time is estimated to be 22 years (see Appendix I in the supplementary material).","The two subspecies of Western Gorilla face similar threats, but to varying degrees in different regions.<br/><br/><ol><li><strong><u>Poaching</u></strong> - Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, hunting for bushmeat is the primary driver of Western Gorilla decline. Current offtake levels are unsustainable – even legally-protected areas suffer high levels of poaching. The remaining population of Cross River Gorillas is small and fragmented, which puts each subpopulation at particular risk from poaching. While Gorillas do not generally appear to be targeted by hunters, it is estimated that opportunistic hunting removes at least 1–3 Cross River Gorillas from the population each year. Additionally, snares targeting other species may trap Gorillas, causing injury or death. Until the mid-1990s, much of the Western Lowland Gorilla’s range included vast, roadless blocks of forest that were extremely difficult to access, where human population densities were very low and Gorilla densities high. In the last quarter century, however, almost all unprotected terra firma forest in this region has been allocated as logging concessions (Global Forest Watch 2016). This means that much of the once-remote, inaccessible forest is now covered by a network of logging roads (Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007), which gives easy access to both hunters entering the forest and traffickers taking consignments of bushmeat (and ivory) out of the forest to distant destinations – often towns and cities where meat fetches high prices. Throughout Central Africa, mining permits for prospecting or resource extraction are being issued over an increasingly large surface area. As well as direct removal of Gorilla habitat, depending on the type of extraction, mining leads to very high rates of human immigration and the creation of yet more access roads, which are used for poaching (e.g., Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014). The region’s governance is typically poor (Transparency International 2016); the weak law enforcement and corruption that enable poaching are evident in ivory trafficking (Bennett 2014), but also widespread elsewhere (Bour <em>et al</em>. 2013). In addition, huge road projects that will substantially fragment Gorilla habitat are currently underway (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). The ease and speed of transport is now orders of magnitude higher than before the creation of such access roads, and hunting pressures are much higher. Across their range, Gorilla densities are lowest near roads, except where forest guards operate control points or roadblocks (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). In addition, human populations in these once remote areas have grown, as people migrate to the employment opportunities offered by logging companies (Wilkie <em>et al</em>. 2000, Poulsen <em>et al</em>. 2009).</li><li><u><strong>Disease</strong></u> - The second major driver of Western Lowland Gorilla decline is infectious disease, specifically Ebola virus disease (EVD). Surveys carried out from the 1980s to the present day show that there were a series of massive great ape die-offs in a large, mostly-intact forested area straddling the border between northeastern Gabon and northwestern Congo, which includes several national parks and logging concessions (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003; Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2013). Walsh <em>et al</em>. (2008) estimated that three quarters of Western Lowland Gorillas in six protected areas affected by <em>Ebolavirus</em> were lost between 1995 and 2000. Typical mortality rate during the worst disease outbreaks was 95% (Bermejo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Caillaud <em>et al</em>. 2006). In protected areas, populations hit by disease began to recover within a decade (e.g., Genton <em>et al</em>. 2012); however, total recovery would take 75–131 years in the absence of poaching, which is an unlikely scenario (Ryan and Walsh 2011). Ebola virus has already been detected to the east of the Mambili River, a major river barrier between Odzala-Kokoua National Park and the Sangha River (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2014). Although rivers and forest fragmentation seem to present a partial barrier to the spread of Ebola, large numbers of Gorillas could be wiped out in a short space of time, as transmission between individuals is rapid and large areas can be affected by a single outbreak (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2009). The small size of the Cross River population means it is also highly vulnerable to infectious disease. <em>Ebolavirus</em> has not been reported in the Cross River Gorillas, but their close proximity to dense human populations and livestock heightens the risks of disease transmission (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2014).</li><li><strong><u>Habitat degradation and destruction</u></strong> - Habitat loss is emerging as a major threat to Western Gorillas. As oil-palm plantations in Asia reach capacity, Africa is becoming the new frontier for this crop, offering excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperatures (Rival and Lavang 2014). Unfortunately, such areas coincide with good Gorilla habitat: 73.8% of the Western Lowland Gorilla’s range is considered suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014). The recent expansion of industrial-scale mineral extraction and the creation of open-pit mines are of great concern (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lanjouw 2014), and also lead to the establishment of development corridors, which can be several kilometres wide and add to areas of “lost forest” (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is a disconnect between the various bodies responsible for land-use planning in the realms of conservation, mining and agriculture in all Western Gorilla range states except Gabon. Consequently, there is increasing competition for land between long-term conservation needs and immediate financial gain as governments explore the potential of clearing natural habitat in favour of economic development. Without careful and immediate land-use planning that involves cooperation between the government bodies responsible for protected areas and wildlife on one hand, and economic and agricultural development on the other, large areas of Western Lowland Gorilla habitat could be cleared within a few decades. The lack of effective protected area management throughout much of the Cross River Gorilla’s range combined with the lack of protected status for much of the Gorillas’ habitat in Cameroon, threatens the future availability of habitat suitable for the population. Conversion of forest for agriculture and grazing is occurring rapidly in many parts of the Gorillas’ range and the largest protected areas in which Cross River Gorillas occur contain enclaves of human settlements whose farmlands have spread beyond their legal boundaries. Expansion of these settlements and associated development of access routes in the form of roads and bridges inside the protected areas exacerbate subdivision of the Cross River Gorilla population. In both Cameroon and Nigeria, the construction and improvement of roads outside protected areas also threatens to increase subdivision of Gorilla populations through habitat disturbance and intensification of forest resource extraction. Increasing access will also exacerbate poaching pressure. While most habitat loss in the region is the result of small-scale agriculture, commercial logging and industrial agriculture (e.g., for oil palm) are also impending threats.</li><li><strong><u>Climate change</u></strong> - Climate change will affect both subspecies of Western Gorilla, as it is already thought to be affecting the Central African tropical moist forests (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although the likely impacts of global climate change are not yet known, some predictions suggest a drying of this region with potentially negative consequences for forest ecology, such as changes in fruit and flower phenology, forest productivity and increased vulnerability to fire, and even forest retreat (James et al. 2013). Seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature, and weather extremes are likely ongoing and set to continue (Lovett 2015). Negative impacts on great apes have already been predicted (Lehmann <em>et al</em>. 2010), particularly along the coast (Korstjens <em>et al</em>. 2010). Climate change is the least likely factor for which effective action for great apes and for African tropical forests in general can be taken in a timely manner. Climate talks in 2015 resulted in international cooperative agreement between most of the world’s nations regarding the need for action; however, the task of reversing, or even flattening current temperature trends will be extremely challenging.</li><li>For more details, see the two <em>Gorilla gorilla</em> subspecies assessments.</li></ol>","Estimates of Gorilla population size are usually made using a standard index of abundance: night nest abundance and distribution, sometimes combined with predictive modelling.<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. diehli<br/></em></strong>Intensive surveys carried out in 1990–2005 suggested that approximately 250–300 Cross River Gorillas persist in a forested area of roughly 12,000 km² (Bergl 2006, Oates <em>et al</em>. 2007). Monitoring of the Gorillas at multiple sites and genetic analysis at select locations (Arandjelovic <em>et al</em>. 2015) has confirmed the small size of the subspecies population, while also documenting a larger geographic range than previously recorded (Bergl <em>et al</em>. 2012, Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2014). Cross River Gorillas occur in at least geographically distinct 11 localities (<em>ibid</em>.) Genetic evidence suggests that these subpopulations have had reproductive contact in the recent past (Bergl and Vigilant 2007); however, field surveys paired with remote sensing analysis reveal that forest corridors connecting subpopulations may no longer be functional as routes for dispersal (Imong <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. gorilla</em></strong><br/>Western Lowland Gorillas are found in almost all protected areas and many of the logging concessions in their range; they can persist at high densities in well-managed logging concessions (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160; Strindberg <em>et al</em>. (2018) produced the first range-wide estimate for the subspecies, giving a total population in 2013 of 361,919 (302,973-460,093). Their numbers declined by 19.4% between 2005 and 2013, corresponding to an annual loss of approximately 2.7% (<em>ibid</em>.). By the end of 2018, numbers will decline by a further 13.5% to roughly 316,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gorilla gorilla</em> is found in Angola (Cabinda enclave), Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni), Gabon, Nigeria and Republic of Congo. Until recently, the core population had an almost continuous distribution from southern CAR to the Congo River and west to the coast. Rivers are the primary geographic barrier for this taxon, followed by habitat fragmentation: the two subspecies are separated by a major river (the Sanaga), and Western Lowland Gorillas are divided into subpopulations by other major rivers in the region (Anthony <em>et al</em>. 2007, Fünfstück <em>et al</em>. 2014, Fünfstück and Vigilant 2015).<br/><br/>The northwestern limit of the western lowland subspecies distribution is the Sanaga River in Cameroon; the northern limit is the forest-savanna boundary to a maximum of roughly 6°N; the eastern limit is the Ubangi River; the Congo River south of its confluence with the Ubangi then becomes the southeastern and southern limits all the way to the coast. Small outlying populations of the Cross River subspecies remain on the Nigeria-Cameroon border at the headwaters of the Cross River and in the proposed Ebo National Park in Cameroon. Most Western Gorillas are found below 500 m asl, but those living on mountains occasionally reach elevations of 1,900 m asl.","<p>Gorillas are completely protected by national and international laws in all countries of their range, and it is, therefore, illegal to kill, capture or trade in live Gorillas or their body parts.<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"National and international laws controlling hunting or capture of Gorillas exist in all habitat countries, but enforcement of protective legislation is inconsistent or lacking throughout much of the species’ range. <em>Gorilla gorilla</em> is listed under Appendix I of CITES and in Class A of the African Convention.<br/><br/>Only ~22% of Western Lowland Gorillas live inside protected areas, which cover ~14% of their geographic range (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). A further 20% are found in FSC-certified logging concessions, adding up to 8% of the range (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although forest guards work in many protected areas and in the well-managed logging concessions, 58% of Western Lowland Gorillas and 77% of their range are unprotected and highly vulnerable to poachers.<br/><br/>The Cross River Gorilla population is small and fragmented and their habitat is surrounded by some of the most densely populated human settlements in Africa. Approximately 30% of Cross River Gorillas occur outside of protected areas and many important habitat corridors between subpopulations exist as ungazetted land. The recent creation of new protected areas in Cameroon combined with existing protected areas in Nigeria, provides the legal framework for habitat protection and the control of hunting. However, effective management of these reserves remains a challenge. Illegal activities, including poaching, occur in all the region’s protected areas. Resources, equipment and training, in addition to proper oversight are needed for these areas to operate effectively.<br/><br/>Targeted conservation action plans have been produced for both Cross River Gorillas (Oates <em>et al</em>. 2007, Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Western Lowland Gorillas (Tutin <em>et al</em>. 2005, IUCN 2014). A series of recommendations have been outlined, which can be broadly encapsulated as:<br/><ol><li>An increase in effective law enforcement throughout the region, not only in protected areas, but also in logging concessions and unprotected forests. Law enforcement needs to be supported by updated regulations and sanctions.</li><li>Effective, coordinated land-use planning to avoid the clearing of intact Gorilla habitat to establish industrial plantations, for oil palm in particular (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014). Industrial extraction of other natural resources, namely timber and minerals, should be included in a holistic, spatially-explicit approach. Such planning needs to be done at both national and regional levels. Several of the most important areas for Gorilla conservation are transboundary, and thus fall within the remit of national agencies from two or three countries.</li><li>Awareness raising among all sectors that deal with land and the protection of natural resources: law enforcement and judiciary; protected area authorities; mining, logging and agricultural industries; local communities and tour operators. This outreach effort should include specific information on minimising human impacts, such as preventing transmission of human diseases to great apes.

154209091,4230,Allochrocebus solatus,Near Threatened,B1ab(iii),2019,2019-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Near Threatened, as it has an extent of occurrence (EOO) estimated at 25,300 km² in central Gabon. Within this, it occurs in an area of 18,000 km² (Coad <em>et al</em>. 2011), with the population centred on the unprotected Forêt des Abeilles. Subsistence hunting is widespread across this range (Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2015) and has reduced small primates to very low densities close to villages (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2011). At some village sites within the range, <em>Allochrocebus solatus</em> is no longer recorded (Gautier <em>et al</em>. 1992, Coad <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is likely that over time, hunting will reduce the EOO of this taxon to below the threshold of 20,000 km², at which point it will meet the threshold for Vulnerable under criterion B1.","This species lives in single-male, multi-female groups (Brugière and Gautier 1999). It occurs in mature mixed forests and occasionally in secondary lowland moist forest. Sun-tailed Monkeys prefer densely shaded, tangled areas and there is some evidence that they avoid the very mature forests at the higher altitudes of the southern Massif du Chaillu, where the understorey is relatively clear (Brugière 2005). However, they are also absent from the dense Marantaceae belt of northern Lopé NP (Coad <em>et al</em>. 2011), so extremely dense understorey may also be unsuitable for them. They remain common after light logging (Brugière 2005), perhaps because dense undergrowth develops in logging light gaps in areas with previously relatively clear understorey. Although data are sparse, this species is known to be mainly frugivorous. Sun-tailed Monkeys sometimes raid crops around villages.","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Allochrocebus solatus</em> is hunted illegally for meat (although it is reported to be difficult to hunt, because of its cryptic behaviour: Gautier and Brugière 2013). Hunting pressure on all small primates seems to be relatively low across much of this region (Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016), but commercial hunting is already unsustainable around villages and may become a more widespread threat (Coad 2007, Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2011). Being semi-terrestrial, this species is sensitive to ground snares (a common form of hunting in the region). Allochrocebus solatus is rarely recorded in village hunting catches, but this may be due to its preference for more mature forest habitat, or to past hunting having already reduced densities close to villages. Habitat loss and/or degradation, mainly due to logging, including in the Forêt des Abeilles, which is largely allocated to logging concessions, is also a threat (Gautier and Brugière 2013).<br/><br/>All records of this taxon fall within an unbroken forest extent without biogeographic barriers. Threat levels vary greatly within this area: in national parks, hunting and habitat modification are forbidden; however, most <em>A. solatus</em> occur in logging concessions that are subject to bushmeat hunting.</p>","The population density of this species varies with habitat suitability and seemingly with altitude: at the Makandé Field Research Station, the density was estimated at 25 individuals per km² (Brugière and Gautier 1999). In southern Lopé, the mean density was about four individuals per km² (Brugière 2005).",Unknown,"<em>Allochrocebus solatus</em> is endemic to central Gabon with a total range thought to be in the order of 25,300 km². which includes much of Lopé National Park and the Forêt des Abeilles logging concessions east of Lopé. It occurs in the older forests of Lopé from about 0.33°S, but is not found in the most northerly, and extremely well-studied, dense Aucoumea-dominated Marantaceae forests. It is likely that this species also occurs in small areas of Birougou and Waka national parks. The northern and eastern biogeographical limits appears to be the Ogooué River: decades of intensive wildlife research based out of the Makokou field station in north-central Gabon, plus an extensive network of camera-trapping 2004–2018 (Wildlife Conservation Society and Panthera data archives) has never recorded them north of the Ogooué. Also, all but one observation are to the west of 12.66°E; a single more easterly observation was of a family troop at 13°E. The western limit to date is 11.2°E, but may extend further. The southern limit is unclear: the most southerly record coming from 1.83°S, in the Massif du Chaillu (Gautier <em>et al</em>. 1992, Brugière and Gautier 1999, Coad <em>et al</em>. 2011).<a name=""_GoBack""></a>","This monkey is seen in bushmeat markets occasionally, or for sale at roadsides.",Terrestrial,"About 16.7% of the species' range is in the Lopé, Waka and Birougou national parks (almost all of which is in Lopé), but the highest recorded density of this species is in the unprotected Forêt des Abeilles, thus enforcement of hunting regulations is crucial.

Multiple examples of population reduction have been documented in Cameroon, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea, and these monkeys are now considered rare across much of their range (Oates 2011). This species lives in proximity to the Atlantic coast, where the forests have been greatly modified for agriculture; industrial agricultural plantations (bananas, oil palm, rubber) and smallholder farming have now replaced much of the original forest. It is likely that this species has undergone a decline exceeding 50% during the past 27 years (three generations), qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A2.<br/><br/>The causes of this decline have not ceased, are unlikely to be reversible, and will continue into the foreseeable future. With the human population growing at a rate of 2.7% annually (i.e. the human population will double in less than 30 years), there will be an 18% increase in the number of people living in this region by 2028. As a consequence, both bushmeat hunting pressure and habitat loss (to agriculture) will continue to increase throughout the geographic range of C. torquatus. More forest will be converted to the type of habitat that is highly unsuitable for these monkeys (monocultures of food crops and rubber). The resulting ongoing population reduction is likely to exceed 50% over three generations (2001–2028), also qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A4.","This species is usually found in high forest, but it also occurs in mangrove, dryland, gallery and swamp forest (Cooke 2005, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007, Oates 2011). It can also be found in young secondary forests and around cultivated areas. Group size is generally between 14 and 25 animals (and occasionally up to ~60) (Oates 2011).","<em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> is threatened by habitat loss, particularly in the northern half of its range. The Atlantic coastal forests have been greatly modified for agriculture, especially in coastal Cameroon, where industrial agricultural plantations (bananas, oil palm, rubber) and smallholder farming have replaced much of the original forest.<br/><br/>The taxon is also threatened by illegal hunting for bushmeat throughout its range, both for local consumption and for commercial sale to distant urban populations. Its large body size (~10-11 kg for males, ~5-6 for females (Ehardt 2013, Oates 2011), semi-terrestrial habits, large group size and loud vocalisations mean that it is easily detected from a distance, easily shot (or snared), and is selected by bushmeat hunters as it provides more meat per individual shot and cartridge expended. The species was highly intolerant of hunting pressure in a study in Korup NP in Cameroon (Linder and Oates 2011).<br/><br/>Human population growth in the range states of <em>C. torquatus</em> continues at roughly 2.7% annually and will not slow down for several decades (UN 2015, World Bank 2017). More and more land will be required for food for these people, and the increasing industrialisation of agriculture in all of these countries will mean that more and more forest is converted monocultures of food crops and rubber, which are highly unsuitable for these monkeys.<br/><br/>Road access into once-remote forests has increased greatly during the last 20–30 years and will continue to do so at an accelerated rate (Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007, Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015), facilitating hunting and transport of bushmeat to both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016). Habitat loss will also greatly increase along the broad corridors created by these roads (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). By 2050 the region will have little, if any, land left untouched by hunting (Nasi <em>et al</em>. 2011).","<p>                 <a name=""_GoBack""></a>Although the mapped extent of occurrence appears extensive along the coasts of five countries, and the species is sometimes locally abundant in scattered localities, <em>Cercoceus torquatus</em> now appears to be absent from many areas with even low-to-medium hunting pressure (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007), although it is still present in several areas of Nigeria and western Cameroon that have low-to-medium and sometimes high hunting pressure. In their preferred habitat, if there is no hunting, they can be the most abundant primate: this was the case in the south of Loango National Park in Gabon in 2003 (Cooke 2005), where the species was still in good shape a few years later (Morgan 2007).<br/><br/><em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> abundance has, however, been declining for some time and they are now considered rare across much of their range (Oates 2011). They have almost certainly been extirpated from Benin (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Nigeria, surveys since 1995 suggest that the species has been extirpated or is now locally rare in several areas of the Niger Delta and Akwa Ibom State (Ehardt 2013, Ikemeh 2014). They are still relatively abundant in the Cross River NP (Abanyam and Imong 2016), and some adjoining unprotected forests, such as the Eko Esai Community Forest (Imong, pers. obs. 2016); in the southwest of the country in Okomu NP, Omo Forest Reserve, Idanre Forest Reserve and Akure-Ofosu Forest Reserve; and in the Niger Delta, including the Apoi Creek forest area (R. Ikemeh, pers. obs. 2016).<br/><br/>Over 40 years ago, these monkeys were considered to be common in Cameroon, in both Korup NP and Douala-Edea (Struhsaker 1972), but their abundance has subsequently declined greatly (Ehardt 2013). Surveys conducted along the same line transects in Korup NP (2001-2003, 2004-2005, 2013-2015) indicated consistently low sighting frequencies of 0.01-0.02 groups/km walked (Linder <em>et al</em>. 2015). In those surveys, <em>C. torquatus</em> made up only 2-3% of all sightings of primates. In Equatorial Guinea, the species was already declining in 1983 (Ehardt 2013) and a nationwide survey in 2011 failed to record the species at all on 234 km of transects. Interviews in villages indicated that the species was present near only nine of the 40 or so areas surveyed across the country; it was in fact the second rarest monkey in the country according to the interviewees (Ruffler <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In coastal Congo (Conkouati-Douli NP) and Gabon (Loango, Moukalaba-Doudou and Mayumba NPs), <em>C. torquatus</em> is still found in reasonable numbers. In the latter two areas, large troops of both Mandrills (<em>Mandrillus sphinx</em>) and of White-collared Mangabeys have been recorded living sympatrically (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007). <em>Cercocebus torquatus </em>and all but two other monkey species were hunted out of the Kouilou area, south of Conkouati, by 1991 (Dowsett <em>et al</em>. 1991).</p>",Decreasing,"This species’ range is about 270,000 km² of which a separate fragment just north of the main coastal strip could be up to about 3,500 km². <em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> occurs in a wide band of coastal forest from western Nigeria into southern Cameroon, and throughout mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) and Gabon (Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. 1999) to the Gabon-Congo border on the Atlantic shore (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007). The old western limit may have been in Benin, but the species has not been recorded there since at least the 1980s (Neuenschwander <em>et al</em>. 2011). Local hunters interviewed in 2003 mentioned the species occurring near the Benin-Nigeria border (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008), but their presence has not been confirmed (Oates 2011). <em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> seems never to occur more than 350 km from the coast (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007). Its southern limit is probably the Kouilou River in Congo and it certainly still thrives in the Gabon-Congo border area (Makaya 2010). In 1966, an isolated population occurred in Igalaland, Nigeria, about 100 km northeast of the main coastal population in the vicinity of Anyigba in Kogi State, but they are almost certainly gone by now (Oates 2011). This monkey is absent from Bioko Island.","This species is killed illegally for local consumption and for bushmeat trade in local markets.<br/><br/>Surveys of 30 hunters living at the periphery of Korup NP indicated that <em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> made up less than 1% of the total primate offtake (Astaras pers. comm. 2016) and in nearby Banyang Mbo, southwest Cameroon, <em>C. torquatus </em>was the rarest monkey recorded in the bushmeat trade, and indeed made up only 0.5% of the animals recorded (of over 3,000 individuals) (Willcox and Nambu 2007). The extremely low proportion of <em>C. torquatus</em> seen in bushmeat markets is likely due to the animals having been selected out of the available prey base, due to their size. A hunter gets more meat for the bullet with larger animals, and typically, faunal assemblages under human hunting pressure in this region lose the larger species first.",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Hunting is banned within all the national parks of the range states where <em>C. torquatus</em> occurs, so the species is protected on paper within those areas. However, weak application of and poor compliance with the law both in and outside protected areas results in hunting throughout its range.<br/><br/>Each of the range states has a list of protected species. <em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> status in each country is as follows: Cameroon: they are on Class C (may be hunted with a permit (MINFOF 2006); Congo: partly protected (on “Annex II”), meaning they can be hunted with a big game permit (MEFDD 2011); Equatorial Guinea: the hunting, sale and consumption of all primates are forbidden by Presidential Decree (Republic of Equatorial Guinea 2007); Gabon: not mentioned on the Completely or Partially protected lists; and Nigeria: Completely Protected (Federal Ministry of Nigeria 2004).<br/><br/>In Central Africa, south of the Sanaga River, the stronghold of this species appears to be the coastal areas of Congo (Conkouati-Douli NP) and Gabon (Loango, Moukalaba-Doudou and Mayumba). Its strongholds in West Africa include Korup NP in Cameroon, and Okomu and Cross River NPs, and Omo Forest Reserve in Nigeria. The species is still present in a number of protected areas including: Banyang-Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary, Campo-Ma'an NP, Douala-Edea Reserve, Korup NP and the proposed Ebo NP (Cameroon); Conkouati-Douli NP (Congo); Monte Alén NP (Equatorial Guinea); Loango, Mayumba, Moukalaba-Doudou and Pongara NPs, and Sette Cama Forest Reserve (Gabon); and Okomu NP, Cross River NP (Nigeria). Outside the protected areas, the species is increasingly rare to absent, especially in areas with medium-to-high human population density, high agricultural activity, or active logging concessions.<br/></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

This population reduction is ongoing at a similar rate.","This species is found in primary and secondary lowland, submontane, and montane forest, but occurs mainly in montane and submontane moist forest above 800 m (Butynski 2013). They were the most common monkey in the afro-alpine forest zone on Mount Oku, Cameroon in a study by Beeson<em> et al. </em>(1996). It is more rarely found in lowland forest (e.g., to 450 m in the Caldera on Bioko (Butynski and Koster 1994, Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2006) or to 100-300 m in the Idenau forests near Mt. Cameroon) (Gartlan and Struhsaker 1972), and on Bioko it shows a preference for Schefflera forest (González-Kirchner 2004, Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2006). It can also occur in isolated forest patches within montane grasslands (Butynski 2013). It inhabits areas with approximately 2000-9000 mm annual rainfall; among the wettest sites in Africa (Butynski 2013). They have been found in polyspecific groups with <em>Cercopithecus nictitans</em> (Beeson <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;They have semi-terrestrial habits and are found usually in the understorey of the forest (Gartlan and Struhsaker 1972, González-Kirchner 2004). Little is known about feeding behaviour, but the study in Oku showed that about half the diet was fruit and seeds, about 40% shoots, and the rest was flowers, other plant material and a small quantity of insects (Beeson and Lea 1994, Beeson <em>et al.</em> 1996, Butynski 2013). This species lives in groups of 2-19 animals, consisting of one or more males and several females with their young; at Mt. Oku, group size was usually 10 or fewer (Beeson <em>et al.</em> 1996, Butynski 2013).","This species’ population size and distribution have been severely affected by habitat loss and fragmentation resulting from logging and agriculture and hunting. By the 1990s, available habitat for <em>A. preussi</em> &#160;was already greatly reduced on the mainland (Oates 1996). For example, Cameroon’s forests have been severely eroded by cultivation, fire and collection of wood for fuel (Charlotte 2010, de Wasseige <em>et al.</em> 2012, Megevand <em>et al.</em> 2013). Intact highland forest, in which the species is most abundant, is converted across its range to grazing land, farmland and “farm bush” (e.g., Tyukavina <em>et al.</em> (2016)). Forest loss in the most recent year available (2014) was higher than in all previous years (from 2001) in Cameroon, and highest in 2011 and 2014 for Nigeria (World Resources Institute 2016).In some places human population density can reach 300 people per km² (WorldPop 2016), and human population growth in the three range states of the taxon is estimated to continue at roughly 2.7% annually for at least several decades (United Nations 2015, World Bank 2016). Throughout the highlands of the Cameroon volcanic line, much of the previously intact forest has been cleared for agriculture, and these forests suffered greatly in the 1980s and 1990s when the rise in coffee price first led to rapid clearing of the afro-alpine forests of the Cameroon highlands for growing coffee and subsequently—despite the price falling again—led to further clearing by farmers in the hope of future profits (Sunderlin <em>et al.</em> 2000). As a result, little montane forest remains in the mainland part of this species’ range and the largest remaining afroalpine forest block of West Africa is the Kilum-Ijim Forest Reserve which contains Mount Oku (Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>This species is highly susceptible to human predation because it is semi-terrestrial and relatively large-bodied. Hunting has led to a decline in its population across its range, but particularly on Bioko (Cronin <em>et al. </em>2017). It was locally common in the Ndokbou, Kilum-Ijim, and Ebo Forests, and now populations have been extirpated as a result of overhunting (Dowsett-Lemaire &amp; Dowsett 2001, Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2001). An intensive survey in 2009 in the Bakossi Mountains National Park failed to find any although they had been present some years earlier (Fonkwo <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;The montane and sub-montane forests of the Cameroon highlands are the last stronghold for <em>A. preussi</em> on the mainland, but firm data are not currently available on its rate of population decline. While it has been recorded in protected areas in Cameroon and Nigeria (e.g., Takamanda National Park and Cross River National Park), most of the remaining Cameroonian forest in the region lies outside protected areas, and are currently being eroded as a result of cultivations, bush fires and fuel wood collection (Oates <em>et al.</em> 2004). Hunting is also most severe outside protected areas and this monkey is disproportionately targeted given its large size and semi-terrestrial behaviour which make it easily accessible to hunters. The ongoing quest to convert forests to large-scale palm oil plantations in the region is likely to worsen these threats in the coming decade (Linder 2013).&#160;On Bioko, hunting intensity is high, including within the two protected areas, and recent infrastructure development has increased accessibility of remote areas of Bioko’s forests and core areas of the range of <em>A. preussi</em> on the island. A road leading to the summit of Pico Basilé was expanded and greatly improved between 2005-2010. This has greatly facilitated hunting within the reserve, primarily by hunters from Basile Fang, a village at the base of the road, which was founded in 2005 by professional hunters from continental Equatorial Guinea, Rio Muni (Grande Vega <em>et al.</em> 2013). In late 2014, a road bisecting the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve was completed, eroding much of the isolation that had passively protected wildlife populations, including&#160;<em>A. preussi</em>, in the remote Gran Caldera de Luba (Cronin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;&#160;2015, Cronin&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016), and contributed to increased hunting activity within the reserve (D.T. Cronin, unpublished data, 2015-2016).","There has been no comprehensive population survey of this species, except on Bioko where the species has undergone declines exceeding 65% over a 30-year period between 1986 and 2016 (Cronin <em>et al.</em> 2017). On the mainland, the species is uncommon and highly fragmented. Between 1992 and 1994, Beeson <em>et al.</em> (1996) studied a population of the species in the Kilum-Ijim forest area in northwest Cameroon, reporting that it was the most common guenon in the afro-montane forest on Mt. Kilum. However, just seven years later, Maisels <em>et al. </em>(2001), reported that <em>A. preussi</em> remained near Mt. Kilum, but that numbers had fallen since the time of Beeson <em>et al.</em>’s (1996) study. Gadsby found Preuss’ guenon to have the highest relative abundance of all diurnal primates in restricted areas where they occurred (Boshi-Okwangwo and Mt. Cameroon), but that they were unknown in contiguous, lowland forest containing the same complement of conspecifics (1990, 1992). SMART-based ranger patrols facilitated by WCS in Boshi-Okwangwo from March 2011 to January 2018 recorded 21 separate sightings of the species, representing only 5% of all sightings of diurnal primates made.",Decreasing,"This species has a restricted distribution (five separate population fragments) in southwestern Cameroon, southeastern Nigeria, and on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea (three fragments). The total area of all eight fragments is approximately 17,300 km². Its population centres on highlands, including the Cameroon Highlands and Mount Cameroon. It is found from 100-3,000 m, but mainly above 1,000 m, and is most abundant in montane and sub-montane forest up to at least 2,500 m asl (Oates 2011, Butynski 2013). Its range on the mainland extends from the highland areas along the Nigeria-Cameroon border near the Cross River drainage in the north to the Sanaga River in the south, and from the southern slopes of the Obudu Plateau in Nigeria east to the proposed Ebo Forest National Park in Cameroon (Littoral Region) (Oates 2011, Butynski 2013).Its population is fragmented across highland sites throughout the region in Cameroon (the Bamboutos Mountains, Mt.

Insufficient survey data preclude the estimation of a total population size for <em>Piliocolobus badius</em>; however, recent surveys report significant population declines and/or local extirpations. The scale of the decline is inferred from rates of human-induced habitat loss, and evidence of unsustainable rates of hunting. Already small and isolated Western Red Colobus populations are expected to continue declining given that these threats are ongoing and in most places are not being countered, and indeed are likely to increase, driven by the demand for natural resources from a rapidly growing human population in West Africa.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>                   </p>This is a predominantly arboreal species found in a variety of forest types including primary, secondary, and gallery forest, woodland savanna, tree and shrub savanna, mangroves and residential gardens (Starin 1991, Galat-Luong and Galat 2005, Struhsaker 2010, Butynski <em>et al</em>. 2013). In general Western Red Colobus prefer mature old growth moist forest, where they use the main canopy at 20-40 m height (50% of time, Galat-Luong 1983), and typically travel on the larger branches (McGraw 1998); however, the northern populations also spend time travelling, resting, playing, feeding and grooming on the ground (Starin 1991).<br/><br/>Their diet is dominated by fruit, seeds and young leaves (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985, Starin 1991, Davies <em>et al</em>. 1999, Korstjens 2001). Multimale-multifemale groups, range in size up to 90 individuals (Butynski <em>et al</em>. 2013), with an average of 26 individuals in Abuko Nature Reserve (Starin 1991), 37 individuals (Galat-Luong 1983) and 53 individuals (Korstjens <em>et al</em>. 2007) in Taï National Park.<br/><p></p>","<p>                   </p>The two major threats to Western Red Colobus are hunting and habitat loss.<br/><br/>Red colobus are extremely vulnerable to hunting pressure (Refisch and Koné 2005; Struhsaker 2005, 2010; N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012; Covey and McGraw 2014), and subsistence and commercial hunting have heavily impacted populations of this West African species. Estimates from surveys at bushmeat markets on the Liberia-Côte d’Ivoire border and around Sapo National Park in southeastern Liberia reveal that primates – including <em>P. b. badius </em>– are being hunted at rates that are almost certainly unsustainable (Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). In Côte d’Ivoire, where hunting is especially intensive, this monkey is reported to have disappeared from all areas except Taï National Park, and possibly the Cavally Classified Forest to the north of Taï National Park (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and in relic forest in the Tonkpi region, near Côte d’Ivoire’s border with Guinea and Liberia (Kramoko <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>It is estimated that in Guinea-Bissau almost 200 red colobus are hunted during each dry season to supply the two urban bushmeat markets and the meat is consumed in dedicated bushmeat restaurants (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Guinea, the intensity of hunting has increased since 2000, with bushmeat also coming from Niokolo Koba in Senegal to supply the city of Conakry and large towns (Galat-Luong and Galat pers. obs. 1983–2000). In addition, skins are used in animistic practices and traded in dedicated markets (Sá <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Offtake levels are likely increasing due to increased hunting associated with significant human population growth and habitat degradation. Hunting has increased due to heightened demand for bushmeat, increasingly fragmented and smaller forest blocks, and improved access to forest interiors through logging (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015, Sloan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Indeed, the human population has increased by more than 100% in the seven range countries since 1990 (Worldometer 2020).<br/><br/>Deforestation through logging, charcoal production, mining and clearance for agricultural land, including industrial-scale plantations, has occurred over much of the species range (McGraw 1998, Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015, WCF 2015).<br/><br/>In the <em>P. b. badius</em> subspecies’ range, analysis of satellite imagery of tree cover shows that Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea were among the 10 countries with the fastest annual rate of forest loss in the world in the 2001–2014 period (Petersen <em>et al</em>. 2015). According to Global Forest Watch, Côte d’Ivoire lost about 17% of its forest cover between 2000 and 2015 with an annual deforestation rate of 2.69% – among the highest in the world. Many areas in Côte d’Ivoire designated as protected areas no longer contain forest and have been largely or completely converted to plantations (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015). A list of countries with the largest increase in primary forest loss during 2018 includes two <em>P. badius badius</em> host countries in the top 10: Côte d’Ivoire was ranked second (26% increase) and Liberia (12% increase) was ranked sixth. When the world’s countries are ranked by the amount of primary forest lost as a percentage of the country’s total, Côte d’Ivoire is second (1.88%) and Sierra Leone is sixth (1.23%) (all forest loss data GFW 2019).<br/><br/>In the <em>P. b. temminckii </em>subspecies’ range, 16.2% (&gt;15,000 km²) of forest habitat has been lost in the past 17 years (2001–2018, GFW 2019; 1.7 generations for this taxon). Total forest lost during this period varied between 9.2% in Senegal and 16.6% in Guinea. With the exception of Gambia, rates of forest loss have more than doubled since 2013 in all range countries (GFW 2019). However, forest loss would have been occurring continuously long before 2001; extrapolating the lowest estimate of forest loss (9.2%) to the decade 1990–2000, gives an estimated total of 22% of suitable habitat lost over three generations.<br/><br/>Degradation and loss of natural habitat also lead to increasing human-wildlife-human conflict (e.g., Starin 1989; Struhsaker 2005, 2010; Galat <em>et al</em>. 2009).

In Gambia, red colobus are rarely hunted for meat, but they are often killed as a crop-protection measure (Starin 1989), and their body parts are used for traditional practices (Starin 2007).<br/><br/>Bushmeat trade takes place in both rural and urban areas, and trade estimates strongly suggest unsustainable levels of exploitation that, if not controlled, will continue to result in&#160; extirpation of this taxon in parts of its range. Indeed, commercial hunting in Guinea-Bissau may have been contributing to its rarity in Cufada Lagoons Natural Park (Ferreira da Silva 2016) and disappearance of groups in Cantanhez Forest National Park (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2016). Estimates from surveys at bushmeat markets on the Liberia-Côte d’Ivoire border and around Sapo National Park in southeastern Liberia reveal that primates are being hunted at rates that are almost certainly unsustainable (Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). For example, it was estimated that approximately 9.5% of the 9,400 primate carcasses brought annually from Liberia’s Konobo District to one bushmeat market on the Cavally River were red colobus (Covey and McGraw 2014).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.<br/><br/>Western Red Colobus have been recorded in a number of protected areas including: Taï National Park and possibly the Cavally Classified Forest in Côte d'Ivoire; Abuko Nature Reserve, Kiang West National Park, River Gambia National Park and Tanji Bird Reserve in the Gambia; Badiar National Park and the Forêt classée de N’dama in Guinea; Cantanhez Forest National Park, Cufada Lagoons Natural Park and Dulombi-Boé-Tchetche Complex in Guinea-Bissau; Gola Forest National Park, Grebo-Krahn National Park, North Lorma National Forest and Sapo National Park in Liberia; Niokolo Koba National Park and Saloum Delta National Park in Senegal; and Gola Rainforest National Park, Loma Mountains National Park, Outamba-Kilimi National Park and Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary in Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>The first conservation action plan for red colobus monkeys will be published in 2020.

They also occur in forests around Bukit Lawang.</p><p>During a field study in Aceh Sumatran slow lorises were observed catching insects and consuming bland fruits (Nekaris and Nijman, 2007). The diet of slow lorises generally consists of insects, nectars, and gums supplemented with occasional fruit and small vertebrates; exudates have emerged as a key resource and are most likely a key resource in the Sumatran slow loris’ diet as well, a prediction supported by their stout dentition and other morphological adaptations to this dietary specialisation (Das <em>et al</em>. 2014, Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wiens <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;</p>","A key threat to the Sumatran Slow Loris is habitat loss (Kasia <em>et al</em>. 2011).

Similar to other <em>Nycticebus</em> species found in the pet trade, traders remove the teeth of the Sumatran slow loris to prevent them from biting owners, but this gruesome act regularly results in infection and death. Those with removed teeth are no longer eligible for reintroduction and those who are eligible for reintroduction are often released with a poor understanding of their taxonomy and geographical range. This species, which is limited to north Sumatra, has been haphazardly released in the southern regions of Sumatra and in Java. &#160;</p><p>Since 2009 slow lorises have become increasingly popular on social media (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013).

Furthermore, Indonesia supported the 2007 up-listing of <em>Nycticebus</em> to CITES I (Nekaris and Nijman, 2007b).</p><p>Despite this protection, enforcement is challenging, and penalties issued in the rare instances when lorises are confiscated are meagre (Shepherd <em>et al</em>. 2005). Surveys and studies on the Sumatran slow loris are needed to confirm population densities and conservation threats.</p><p>Several rescue centres have been opened to receive Sumatran Slow Lorises from the illegal trade. Unfortunately, most of these centres do not distinguish between any slow loris species, and Sumatran forms (either <em>N. hilleri</em> or <em>N. coucang</em>) have been: released in the wrong location; released without health checks; released with no post release monitoring; released in large numbers in a single location (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2008). The last criterion is particularly dangerous since slow lorises are venomous. Venom is used as a defence against conspecifics. As slow lorises have very large highly defended ranges, this form of reintroduction is dangerous not only to the release but also to resident slow lorises. It is highly recommended that such well-meaning organisations follow the IUCN Recommendations for Translocations, as such reintroductions probably do more harm than good.</p><p>Some conservation education programmes are in place, but not systematic.

Based on samples from the littoral forest of Mandena a new form has been separated from <em>M. murinus</em> and been named as <em>M. ganzhorni</em> based on genetic grounds (Hotaling <em>et al.</em> 2016). Morphologically <em>M. ganzhorni</em> is indistinguishable from <em>M. murinus</em> and difficult to distinguish from <em>M. griseorufus</em> (<em>M. griseorufus</em> has a white belly with white underfur while <em>M. murinus</em> and <em>M. ganzhorni</em> have greyish underfur) and thus, taxonomic assignments in the field remain uncertain without genetic analyses.

Hunting for food follows immigration into new areas, with young night monkeys also routinely taken as pets in the process. Given that this species appears to adapt to shrinking habitats, it's  rate of decline may not be as precipitous, but is still sufficiently  significant to qualify it as threatened.","Little is known about the population characteristics of <em>Aotus miconax</em>.

A suspected population decline caused by significant and accelerating rates of deforestation is projected to continue and perhaps accelerate. Combined with the facts that more than 90% of the population is believed to occur outside of protected areas, and the species continues to be hunted for food and medicinal purposes, a population loss equalling or exceeding 50% can be anticipated over three generations (between the years 2000 and 2045).<br/></p>","<p>This gibbon is a forest-dweller that inhabits primary evergreen, scrub and semi-deciduous hill forest, as well as mountainous broadleaf forest, but it cannot survive in pine-dominated forest. It ranges up to 2,700 m in elevation in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;(P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013). The annual mean temperature is 13.3&#160;°C and 13.1°C&#160;at two sites of Mt.&#160;Gaoligong.&#160;Gibbon habitat can be covered by snow in cold winters.<br/> <br/> Two habituated groups are well studied by Fan Peng-Fei. and his team. Annual diet of a group in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;comprised 49.1% fruit (non-fig fruit 35.6%and fig 13.5%), 43.3% leaves (buds, young and mature leaves), 5.3% invertebrates and bird chicks, 1.8% flowers, and 0.6% others. Individuals prefer ripe fruits when they are available. They shift their diet to leaves and buds and&#160; increased feeding time when fruits and figs are not available (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013). Groups use large home ranges (93 and 178 ha for two groups), and use different sections monthly (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>., 2017; Zhang <em>et al</em>., 2014). Their daily travel distance varied from month to month (group&#160;BB: mean&#160;=&#160;1,308 ± SD 735 m, range&#160;=&#160;272–3,705 m, N = 60 days; group NA: mean&#160;=&#160;1126 ± SD 488 m, range&#160;=&#160;345–2,606 m, N = 52 days (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2017), mostly depends on their diet and food availability. They decrease travel distance when they eat more leaves (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Adults live in pairs and coordinate their singing to produce duet bouts that lasted for an average 25.5 min. Paired adults never produce solo bouts unless they are separated by human disturbances. The singing rate (number of bouts/number of monitoring days) of four groups in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;range from 7.5% to 31.4% which was lower than other gibbon populations, presumably due to low group density and prevalence of hunting at the study site (Yin <em>et al.</em>, 2016).&#160;&#160;One group stop calling for 68 days after at least 30 gunshots were heard from its home range.<br/><br/>Like other gibbons, Skywalker Hoolock Gibbons sleep in tall trees, and rarely use the same tree on consecutive days. They travel very fast to enter sleeping trees 2-3 hours before sunset. They mostly sleep on branches of diameter less than 10 cm and close to tree tops. Anti-predation is an important factor that affects Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon’s sleeping behavior (P.-F. Fan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Neighbouring groups rarely fight along territory borders. Only one inter-group conflict was recorded in four years (Yin <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>","<p>In China, although commercial logging has been banned, <em>Hoolock tinxiang</em> is threatened by small-scale habitat loss, degradation, fragmentation, and hunting (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Yin <em>et al</em>. 2016). Local people believe that the brain of&#160;hoolock&#160;gibbons can be used to cure epilepsy. Nearly half of the remnant population now live in agro-forestry complexes (e.g., cardamom cultivation)<em></em>. Although cardamom cultivation causes some negative effects on gibbons, these agro-forestry complexes provide important gibbon habitat provided they are not too fragmented and hunting is prohibited (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, <em>H. tinxiang</em> remains threatened by habitat loss due largely to slash-and-burn agriculture, gold mining and logging, and secondarily by hunting for food and medicinal purposes (Ni <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160; Unfortunately, the species is not known to occur in any protected areas in this country.&#160; According to the most recent Global Forest Watch (2019) data for Myanmar, the six administrative divisions in which <em>H. tinxiang</em> is believed to occur - Shan, Mandalay, Kayah, Bago, Kayan and Mon - have lost nearly 9% of their forest cover since 2000, are collectively losing forest at a rate above the national average, and that rate has accelerated significantly in recent years. The previous gibbon generation (2000–2015) could have been expected to decline at a corresponding rate, and the present generation (2016–2030) and subsequent generation (2031–2045) can be expected to decline at a corresponding rate as well - this would result in a population decline related to habitat loss of at least 30%.&#160; Should the current rate of loss continue to accelerate, which it appears to be doing, and hunting continue as well, a decline in population approaching or exceeding 50% can easily be anticipated.<br/></p><p>  </p><p></p>","<p>In China, the population is estimated to be approximately 200 individuals in nine (9) subpopulations<em></em> (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, population estimates have ranged between 10,000 and 50,000 individuals (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2013). Even at the lower end of that range, the Myanmar population would represent at least 98% of the species' total.<br/><br/>Based on deforestation data for Myanmar since 2000, the region inhabited by this species has already experienced a significant and accelerating loss of forest. It is not known to occur in any protected areas of that country.

A suspected population decline of &gt;30% over the course of the last two generations (2000-2017), caused by a dramatic increase of unregulated commercial bushmeat hunting since the Congo wars, is likely to continue over the course of the current generation (2018-2026), as this species is still preferred by many hunters. Although no detailed population data exists, the species has not been observed recently in three of the six protected areas in which it is previously reported to have occurred (Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve, Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve, Luo Scientific Reserve), raising questions regarding its possible or eventual extirpation in those protected areas. Ongoing habitat loss also contributes to the presumed population decline.","<p>To date, there has been one detailed study of <em>Piliocolobus tholloni </em>ecology at the Botsima study site along the Lomela River in SNP (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 1994). Botsima was protected from hunting pressure, and contained patches of swamp, seasonally-flooded and terra firma forest habitat. The habituated study group included over 60 individuals and ranged throughout the 250 ha study site. Maisels <em>et al</em>. (1994) collected feeding data for 12 months and reported that the group’s diet consisted of 60.7% leaves (54.3% young, 6.4% mature), 30.8% seeds, 7.1% ripe fruit, and 1.4% flowers. <em>P. tholloni </em>in the study ate mostly legumes, and the leaves and seeds came from species in the Caesalpinioideae subfamily. In the Etate Surveillance Zone of SNP, an area with active poaching patrols, maximum group sizes were 45 individuals (n = 73 group sightings, average group size = 12.6 individuals) and 31 individuals (n = 28 group sightings, average group size = 13.9 individuals) for two different patrol survey periods in 2014 (Reinartz pers. comm. 2016).</p><p>In the Lukuru study area at the southern limit of the species’ range, <em>P. tholloni</em> ranges in upland dry forest, utilising the middle canopy (Thompson 2000). At the eastern edge of the range in LNP, the species is common in terra firma forests characterized by clay soils and small rivers that cut narrow valleys across the landscape, but it avoids seasonally-inundated forest.<em> </em>At the Losekola study site in LNP, 39 groups of <em>P. tholloni</em> were encountered during transect walks (total transect length = 143 km) and group size counts ranged from 5-63 individuals (average group size = 29.9 individuals), including two groups each estimated to have over 90 individuals (J. Hart unpublished survey data, 2008). <em>P. tholloni</em> is reported to occur frequently in mixed-species groups of primates in Lukuru and in LNP (Thompson 2000, Lukuru Foundation 2015). The species appears to be limited to closed canopy forests and has not been recorded in gallery forests south of the main forest block.</p>","<p>Across its range, <em>P. tholloni</em> is vulnerable to hunting, which has increased markedly since the Congo wars (1996-2003). Observations during wildlife surveys in the upper Tshuapa Basin, between the Tshuapa and the Lomami rivers, suggest that <em>P. tholloni </em>may be one of the first primate species hunted out, because they are large and slow to flee (A. Vosper pers. comm. 2007). In some areas, for example Lukuru, <em>P. tholloni </em>appears to be targeted by local hunters because they have a preference for its meat, and some hunters say that church teachings attributed the flavour of <em>P. tholloni </em>to divine intervention (Thompson 2000). However, hunting threats are not uniform, and the species does not always appear to be selected for. For example, before the establishment of the LNP, in the Obenge sector where <em>P. tholloni </em>is common, six shotgun hunters who were monitored on 17 hunting trips, killed <em>P. tholloni</em> only twice (a total 4 individuals; J. Hart pers. obs, 2009). These hunters killed other primate species (total 14 individuals, mostly <em>Cercopithecus </em>spp.), as well duikers and pigs. Five bow hunters in the same sector were monitored on nine hunts, and killed <em>P. tholloni</em> five times (a total of 7 individuals), which represented the entire kill for these hunters (J. Hart, pers. obs.). Market surveys, where groups of similarly-aged fresh carcasses are displayed together, suggest multiple kills at the same event (Thompson 2000, Thompson and Hart 2015). <em>P</em>.<em> tholloni</em> carcasses represented 36% of 229 carcasses recorded over a one-month period at the Basankusu markets (Dupain and van Elsacker 1999, cited in Thompson 2000). A market survey in Lusambo in 2011 recorded <em>P. tholloni</em> accounting for 5% of total carcasses (G. Paluku and E. Mpaka, Lukuru Foundation pers. comm. to via J. Hart, 2016).</p>  <p>Although hunting is the main conservation threat, habitat loss and degradation due to logging and conversion of forest to agricultural landscapes is a growing threat to this species (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). For example, the Sankuru Reserve and Lusambo region, important forest areas in the southeast of <em>P. tholloni</em>’s range, have been identified as new hot spots of forest loss from 2000-2014 (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>","<p>There are no overall population estimates for this species; however, the species can be locally abundant if not hunted.</p>  <p>The large forest blocks and the corridor region of Salonga National Park (SNP) harbour an important population of <em>P. tholloni</em>; however, hunting occurs throughout the region (Liengola <em>et al.</em> 2010, Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010, WCS 2015, WCS 2016). Recent surveys conducted in the northern and southern blocks of SNP and the corridor between the two document that <em>P. tholloni </em>is widely distributed in the protected area, but rare (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010, WCS 2015, WCS 2016). In 2016, field researchers conducting bonobo and elephant surveys in the Watsi Kengo sector of SNP (an area ~4,443 km² between the Yenge and Salonga rivers) recorded opportunistic sightings of <em>P. tholloni</em> and estimated that ~600 individuals occurred over two-thirds of the sector (pers. comm. to Reinartz 2016).</p><p>In the eastern part of the range,&#160;<em>P. tholloni&#160;</em>is widespread in Lomami National Park (LNP) and adjoining buffer zone, ranging from the southern limit of the closed forest (3°S Latitude) northwards to the vicinity of Opala (0.5°S Latitude), west of the Lomami River.&#160;<em>P. tholloni</em>&#160;is common in some sectors of the park, notably Obenge and Losekola (0.27 groups/km, J. Hart unpublished survey data, 2008).</p>  <p>The species was not detected during multiple surveys of the northern Maringa-Lopori-Wamba (MLW) landscape between 2000 and 2014 (Likondo Lokonga 2006, Omasombo and Mpiana 2006, Lushimba 2012, Maputla 2014, Kasa <em>et al</em>. 2015), although there is evidence that <em>P. tholloni</em> occurred historically in the greater Wamba area (Colyn 1991, Thompson 2000). In 2009, <em>P. tholloni</em> was present but very rare in the western Sankuru Nature Reserve, an area where hunting occurs (Liengola <em>et al</em>. 2009). There may be a small population in the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve; however they have not been detected recently within the ~50 km² bonobo study area of the reserve (M. Surbeck pers. comm. 2016). <em>P. tholloni </em>has not been recorded in the Luo and Lomako reserves (Thompson 2000). It was not encountered during recent surveys of the Luo Scientific Reserve and adjacent Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve, although rare sightings have been reported in the Iyondji area in the past (Sakamaki <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Piliocolobus tholloni</em> is a little-known taxon endemic to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The species has a patchy distribution in the forests south of the Congo River and west of the Lomami River (Thompson 2000). The southern limits are bounded by the Kasai and Sankuru rivers (Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, Thompson 2000). The only other Red Colobus taxon to range south of the Congo River is <em>Piliocolobus </em><em>parmentieri</em>, and the ranges of these two allopatric species are separated by the Lomami River. <em>Piliocolobus tholloni</em> has not been found at a number of sites where primate surveys have been conducted, and where the species was expected, suggesting that variation in the age and floristic composition of the forests, along with differences in human disturbance and hunting pressure, may be important in determining the current distribution of the species (Thompson 2000). In addition, rivers bisecting forest regions across the basin likely contribute to the patchy distribution of <em>P. tholloni</em>; for example, this species is known to be absent on the right bank of the Lomela River, but present on the left bank.",Hunted for bushmeat,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Piliocolobus tholloni</em> is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

It is also known to have occurred in the Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve, Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve and the Luo Scientific Reserve.&#160; However, recent surveys in these areas have not encountered red colobus monkeys, so its status is questionable. The species was originally provided total protected status in 1937 by the colonial administration. This was repealed in 1985, leaving the species protected only by local or provincial based hunting seasons (Thompson 2000). As of 2006, <em>P. tholloni </em>is included in the protected species list by the Ministry of the Environment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and thus is fully protected by national law (Enerunga 2006). However, the unregulated hunting that occurs throughout its range, including the killing of <em>P. tholloni</em>, indicates that there is currently inadequate enforcement of this law.</p><p>Efforts to control the killing of <em>P. tholloni</em> can have an impact if multiple points along the bushmeat chain are targeted consistently (Hart and Hart 2011). Before the wildlife laws were enacted, <em>P. tholloni</em> represented &gt; 3% of 4,382 animals arriving in the urban bushmeat markets of Kindu (Hart and Hart 2009). In 2010, following enactment and enforcement of hunting laws, numbers of carcasses dropped, and in 2015 <em>P. tholloni</em> was not found among 6,155 animals recorded (Kabongo 2016; Lukuru Foundation, TL2 Project, unpublished data, 2009, 2016).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

In the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, they are found in monodominant stands of <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</em>, where they feed on flower buds and immature seeds during periods of mast flowering and fruiting (J. Hart, unpublished observations 2007). They do not occur in younger secondary forest. In lowland evergreen forests, <em>P. oustaleti</em> can form large groups where they are not hunted. Counts of up to 70 animals were made in some groups in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the past (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2008); up to 50 in 2011, but the more recent dataset (which only covers about a quarter of the reserve at the time of writing) suggests that group sizes are now smaller (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2018).</p><p>In the Ngotto Forest in CAR, this species only occurs in flooded riverine forests (Gautier-Hion &amp; Brugière 2005). Galat-Luong &amp; Galat (1979) reported that they spent 30% of their time below 10 m above ground and regularly enter into water to collect bulbs of aquatic plants. Large blocks of seasonally- or permanently-inundated forest are found in the west of the species range, in the confluence region of the Congo, Sangha and Ubangi rivers, including Lac Télé in Congo.</p><p>The eastern-most populations of <em>P. oustaleti </em>occupy small isolated forest islands and galleries on the Lake Albert escarpment. Semi-deciduous tree species dominate the high elevation gallery forests where <em>P. oustaleti </em>has been studied recently (Laudisoit <em>et al</em>. 2016, Scholier 2017). Home range size in some of these blocks is highly constrained, suggesting that these populations, which have no means of dispersal, are likely under periodic resource stress.</p>","<p>Habitat loss and hunting are the primary threats to this species. Habitat loss is particularly severe for the populations that occur in small forest islands and galleries at the northern and eastern limits of the range. Sources of deforestation in this environment include growing numbers of small holder farmers, expansion of nomadic pastoralism, small-scale logging and charcoal production. These latter threats are growing in a zone where ready sources of timber and fuel wood are scarce. Even low levels of firewood, house pole collection and timber harvest could have severe impact on populations in these areas, as they are constrained to very small home ranges and may be exposed to periods of stress exacerbated by the removal of key resources.</p>  <p>In parts of DRC, in portions of the range originally covered by contiguous forest, there are growing halos of deforestation around the population centres of Bunia, Isiro, Buta, Lisala and Gemena. A band of forest loss and degradation up to 100 km wide now isolates <em>P. oustaleti</em> populations in the Abubumbazi forest block. Commercial scale oil-palm plantations established in the Lisala area have led to permanent loss of habitat. Areas showing high rates of deforestation affect about 25% of <em>P. oustaleti’s</em> range (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss in the current geographic range of the taxon totaled around 15,000&#160;km²&#160;between 2001 and 2016 (Global Forest Watch/WRI 2018).</p>  <p>Hunting, usually with shotguns, is a threat to <em>P. oustaleti</em>&#160;in a number of areas, including Buta and the Rubi-Télé Hunting Domain (T. Hart, pers. comm. 2007), and across the whole of northern Congo and southwestern CAR outside the areas protected by wildlife guards. Though hunting is not yet common in the Ituri forest, it appears to be a growing threat in the Ituri landscape, in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve and the adjacent, unprotected Mai Tatu forest (R. Mwinyihali, pers. comm. 2018). Widespread hunting was recorded in the Abubumbazi Forest in the northwest extreme of the species range in DRC, where no red colobus were recorded during a brief survey (J. Hart pers. obs. 1989). The bushmeat trade is active around Buta-Aketi (Hicks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Two red colobus were amng 169 monkey carcasses recorded for sale during 2007 and 2008 surveys (Hicks, unpublished data). One red colobus was among 21 identified monkey carcasses encountered between Banalia-Buta-Titulé in 2012 (Hicks 2014).</p>","<p>Given the size of its geographic range,&#160;Oustalet’s Red Colobus&#160;is likely to be among the more numerous of the red colobus taxa (Struhsaker and Grubb 2013). No estimates of <em>P. oustaleti</em>&#160;density are available; however, it has been recorded as common by a number of large-scale surveys. <em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em> was the third most observed species in the flooded forests of Ngotto in southwestern CAR (Brugière <em>et al</em>. 2005), and was classified as common at eight of 12 survey sites covering the central portion of its range (Buta-Aketi Region) from 24 to 26° E (Hicks 2010, 2014, unpublished data). The species was among the most commonly recorded primates in surveys of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve between 1993 and 2011 (Grossman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart <em>et al</em>. 2008, Vosper <em>et al</em>. 2011) although the most recent information shows that its abundance has fallen relative to other species (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2018). A large area in the eastern Ituri forest (Mai Tatu) also harbours this red colobus, although again it is now one of the least commonly recorded (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2008, 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em>&#160;occurs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Republic of Congo (Congo), and has been recorded historically or marginally in South Sudan. It is also present in the extreme southwest of the Central African Republic (CAR). Its extent of occurrence (EEO) is estimated at 766,035 km². The eastern limit of its range is at about 31°E and includes the gallery forests and forest islands on the escarpments above Lake Albert. The northernmost record for the species is 4.50 N is northeastern DRC (Garamba National Park; Groves 2007). North of the Uélé River headwaters, the species has been historically recorded sporadically in gallery forests and forest islands in savanna from northern DRC to southern South Sudan. The Uélé River defines the northern limit of the range from about 210 through 270 E.&#160; Historically, the species was recorded near the forest-savanna boundary between Lisala and Gemena (M. Collet unpublished data 1983). The southern limits of its range are the Aruwimi (Ituri) River and the Congo River to its confluence with the Sangha river at 1013’ S. The western limit is the Sangha River up to the savanna-forest ecotone. <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">P. oustaleti</em> ranges from 350 m elevation at the confluence of the Sangha and Congo rivers, to 1,850 m in the gallery forests above Lake Albert.<br/><br/>The species appears to be absent from a number of locations at its northern and eastern limits, where it was known historically, including Garamba National Park (K. Smith pers. comm. 2018). Contrary to Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. (1999), <em>P. oustaleti</em> does not occur north of the Uélé River west of 27 0 E. This includes large undisturbed blocks of closed forest in the Bili-Gangu region where recent surveys documented a rich forest primate fauna, but failed to find this species (Hart 2012; Hicks 2010, 2014). It appears that the populations that have been documented in small forest islands and galleries in the northern Uélé headwaters, never ranged west across the open savannas of the Ango-Digba region to reach these closed forests. The Uélé River, at this longitude, apparently represents a major barrier to dispersal by populations from the forest blocks to the south.</p><p>  </p><p>&#160;</p>  <p><br/></p>  <br/><p></p>",This species is hunted illegally.

The High Grand Falls Dam, the second largest dam in Africa, will be accompanied by large-scale irrigation schemes and water transfer to the ‘Lamu Port and Lamu Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor’. The establishment of this dam is expected to have additional negative impacts on the forests of the Lower Tana River and, therefore, on<em> P. rufomitratus.</em></p><p><em></em>One special concern is the rapidly growing human population in the region. Another is the possible annulment of the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR; 169 km²) which the High Court of Kenya ordered in January 2007.

All red colobus species are slow-moving and easily hunted (Struhsaker 2005), as illustrated by a female observed with her infant in northern Congo who remained clearly visible for 15 minutes (Devreese 2015). During this same survey, Devreese (2015) reported evidence of a single hunter claiming to have killed more than 60 red colobus during a single hunting trip. Devreese also identified a substantial commercial trade along the Likouala and Sangha rivers, although this trade may have decreased in recent years due to a perceived threat of contracting Ebola virus disease (Devreese 2015). The immigration of a workforce into logging concessions and access facilitated by logging roads will lead to increasing hunting pressure on wildlife in the northern part of this species' range.</p>  <p>In the southern part of the range, Bouvier’s Red Colobus are hunted in and around the Lesio-Louna Reserve (C.

Both sexes take up linear hierarchies, the top ranking male being dominant to the top ranking female. Subordinate males are often peripheral (Fragaszy <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is a peak birth season with an 18 month inter-birth interval (Fragaszy<em> et al</em>. 2005).

This is based on a combination of factors; continued unregulated hunting for the bushmeat market and continuing habitat loss at increasingly higher rates than in the past.<br/></p>,"<p>There have been no field studies of&#160;<em>Piliocolobus</em> <em>parmentieri</em> and its ecology and behaviour are little known (Struhsaker 2010).</p>  <em>Piliocolobus parmentieri</em> occurs in primary terra firma forest and possibly older secondary forest. The species has not been observed in and is not reported by local villagers to use younger secondary forest and re-growth following agricultural clearing. The species has a localized occurrence within its range as suitable upland habitats are constrained by swamp forest and areas occupied or modified by agriculture. The species was seen in primary forest in the upper Lutanga basin (J. Hart, pers. obs. 2008). Two specimens, acquired from hunters in Opala in 2008, were reportedly taken from this same area (Chaney <em>et al</em>. 2016). In 2016, the species was found again, unexpectedly, near the villages of Lokobekobe and Mokau, considerably south of its previously known range (J. Hart, pers. obs. 2016). These recent discoveries of <em>P. parmentieri</em> are all in areas that have been visited by field teams since 2007, yet the species was not previously reported. This suggests that <em>P. parmentieri</em> is indeed rare with a possibly widely-dispersed occurrence. Further field surveys are urgently needed to determine if other areas still harbour the species.","<p><em>Piliocolobus</em> <em>parmentieri</em> is threatened by both hunting and habitat loss.</p>  <p>Colyn (1991) reported the species to be common in a Kisangani bushmeat market in the 1980s. In a survey of the same market, as well as an inventory of bushmeat available in villages in the vicinity of Kisangani, Dauwe (2014) recorded just three carcasses of all colobine species out of a total 353 total carcasses examined.&#160; More recently, Kyamakya <em>et al.</em> (2019) compiled data from 40 years of survey of the bushmeat trade in Kisangini (1976-2016), which identified red colobus monkeys as a highly favoured species, appearing at its highest numbers in the market in 2016.<br/></p>  <p>Two hunters in Opala who killed individuals of this species in 2008 reported having to travel almost 40 km to find them (J. Hart, pers. obs. 2008). <em>P</em>. <em>parmentieri</em> carcasses were not seen for sale along the roadside during multiple trips in the species’ range, from Kisangani to Opala and Kisangani to Ubundu, between 2007 and 2016, further indication that population numbers are low (J. Hart, pers. obs. 2007-2016).</p>  Over half the historic range of <em>P. parmentieri</em> has been affected by clearing for agriculture (Vancustem <em>et al.</em> 2006). Agricultural conversion is increasing, associated with the commercial production of upland rice for national urban markets. Active logging concessions cover about a quarter of the species’ range (MECNT 2013), with further artisanal-scale extraction of wood for national markets in Kisangani. Increasing logging and agriculture in the range of <em>P. parmentieri</em> is associated with repairs of the existing road network and the expansion of logging roads into the primary forest remaining in the areas under exploitation (Hart 2011).<br/><br/>According to Global Forest Watch data compiled from 2001-2018, annual forest cover loss in DRC's Tshopo region has nearly quadrupled since the turn of the century (from 36,000 ha/yr to 130,000 ha/yr) and continues to accelerate.","<p>No population estimates are available for <em>Piliocolobus parmentieri</em>. The species is now rare or absent in the northern half of its range, due to hunting and habitat loss to shifting agriculture. The area with depleted populations includes most of the Lobaye basin, which Colyn and Verheyen (1987) considered its stronghold less than 30 years ago. Colyn and Verheyen (1987) reported that the species also occurred in the Lutanga basin by in the 1980s, and small numbers were still present in 2008 (J. Hart, pers. obs. 2008). Based on interviews with villagers, the species’ occurrence appears to be highly fragmented (J. Hart, pers. obs. 2008).</p>  <p>Based on known or likely areas of absence and the large portion of its range degraded by shifting agriculture and logging, it can be inferred that the current population likely contains fewer than 2,500 adult animals.<br/><br/>It is suspected that over the three generations from 2009 to 2038, this species will undergo a reduction of at least 50% based on a combination of factors; bushmeat market survey data that indicates this species is favoured by hunters and will continue to be exploited at high levels wherever it occurs; and accelerating rates of forest cover loss within its range will likely result in forest cover loss of 20% or more over the course of three generations (2009-2038).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species&#160;is endemic to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The known historic range of <em>P. parmentieri</em>, estimated at 19,000&#160;km², is located in the Congo (Lualaba)–Lomami interfluves. It is limited by the Congo (Lualaba) River to the north and east, and by the lower Lomami River to the west. The southern limit of the species’ range was originally thought to be defined by a major band of apparently unsuitable habitat dominated by seasonally-inundated forest on white sands (Colyn and Verheyen 1987). Struhsaker and Grubb (2013) report the southern limit as the Ruiki and Lutanga rivers. Local villagers report that the species occurs in the upper Ruiki basin. Discovery of new locations for the species in 2016 have extended the southern range limit to about 1.4° south latitude (J. Hart, pers. obs. 2016).<br/><br/><em>Piliocolobus parmentieri</em> no longer occurs over large areas of its historic range, which have been converted to an agricultural landscape over the last three decades or more. The species is absent from the vicinity of Kisangani, Opala and Ubundu, all human population centres bordering its range. Field surveys in 2007 in the area between Kisangani and Ubundu, where the type specimen originated, failed to reveal any evidence of the animal and no local villagers could report its occurrence (Hart 2011).<br/><br/>Based on vegetation cover estimates (Vancutsem <em>et al</em>. 2006), the remaining area of undisturbed mature forest currently suitable for <em>P. parmentieri</em> comprises less than 10,000&#160;km²&#160;of the species’ known historic range.</p>","Unregulated, illegal hunting occurs throughout the range.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Red Colobus are listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

166605018,18261,Piliocolobus langi,Endangered,A4cd,2020,2018-03-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Piliocolobus langi</em> is assessed as Endangered based upon a suspected population reduction of 50% or more over the course of three generations (2005-2035) due to ongoing, significant hunting pressure and increasing forest loss. This strikingly bi-coloured and uniquely marked taxon has declined over more than 40 years, due primarily to hunting. Evidence of its decline has become more pronounced over the past two decades as habitat loss has accelerated. Hunting and habitat loss will continue to threaten this taxon into the foreseeable future. The range of <em>Piliocolobus langi</em> encompasses the city of Kisangani, with an estimated 1.6 million inhabitants in 2015. Kisangani has one of the largest bushmeat markets in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A summary of market surveys (Laudisoit unpublished data 2018) suggests that <em>P. langi</em> likely made up the bulk of the colobus entering the Kisangani market and that numbers began to decline in the late 1970s through the 1980s. <em>Piliocolobus langi</em> are still hunted; however, today they are uncommon in the Kisangani market, and freshly killed animals are rarely seen. Habitat loss is increasing, with agricultural clearing and small-scale logging leading to deforestation and forest degradation along the road network emanating from Kisangani and crossing the species’ geographic range. Primary forest has been transformed into secondary and regenerating forest of various ages in a growing rural complex over nearly half of the taxon’s range (Vancustem <em>et al</em>. 2006). The remaining blocks of intact habitat are concentrated in the east of the range where <em>P. langi</em> reportedly intergrades with <em>P. ellioti</em>.</p>","The species seems to be restricted to primary forests. Its range includes areas characterized by large stands of monodominant <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</em> forest. The species may use older secondary forests, however, it does not occur in younger regenerating forest. There is no information on its use of selectively logged areas.","Habitat loss and hunting are the primary threats to this species. Its geographic range is fragmented by a network of heavily-travelled national roads emanating from Kisangani, DRC’s second largest city, located on the Congo River at the south-central limit of the taxon’s range. The national highway (RN4) leading from Kisangani to Banalia on the Aruwimi River, at the northern limit of <em>P. langi</em>’s range, is bounded by deforestation and young regeneration produced by shifting cultivation, logging and small-holder farmers. This band of habitat loss ranges in width from 12 to 50 kilometres, and isolates the western third of the taxon’s range. <em>Piliocolobus langi</em> has been subject to heavy hunting pressure for at least four decades. Colyn (1991) characterized <em>P. langi</em> as common throughout the 1980s. Populations were present less than 100 km from Kisangani in the Uma River basin, even as recently as the late 1980s (Colyn 1991), but are now rare or extirpated. Commercial scale logging has been operating in the Tshopo basin, and in the central and western portions of the taxon’s range since the early 1980s. Hunters were known to use the network of logging roads laid out at that time (J. Hart pers. obs. 2000). Rates of conversion of primary forest for agriculture and timber are expected to continue to increase into the foreseeable future.","<p>There are no estimates of this taxon’s population size. Colyn (1991) reported that in the 1980s <em>Piliocolobus langi</em> was regularly seen in the field. Recent field surveys in minimally disturbed habitat near the eastern limit of the taxon’s range, where it purportedly intergrades with <em>P. ellioti</em>, have failed to record the taxon (E. Mpaka pers. comm. 2011). These surveys reported observations of Chimpanzees and their nests, as well as of other primates (<em>Cercopithecus</em> spp.), which suggests that <em>P. langi</em> is now uncommon, even in the remaining intact portions of its range.<br/><br/>It is suspected that over the three generations from 2005 to 2035, this species will suffer a reduction of at least 50%. <em>Piliocolobus langi</em> has been subject to heavy hunting pressure for at least four decades.

It is arboreal, spending most of the time in the upper canopy (Waser 1977, Shah 2003). Diet is highly diverse and consists mainly of fruit and seeds (Waser 1977, Ham 1994, Olupot<em> et al.</em> 1994, Poulsen <em>et al.</em> 2001, Shah 2003). Populations in West-Central Africa (Gabon) eat most seeds – up to 58% in some forests (Ham 1994, Brugière <em>et al.</em> 2002), than groups studied in Uganda. This monkey lives in groups of 5–30 individuals, is non-territorial and has home ranges of 2–4 km²,&#160;which overlap extensively&#160;(Waser 1977, Olupot <em>et al.</em> 1994, Shah 2003). It is large bodied (7-11 kg; Olupot &amp; Waser 2013).","This species is directly threatened by habitat loss and hunting, and indirectly by increasing human populations and the creation of easy access routes into huge areas of previously remote forests. Hunting is an increasing threat throughout the range of this taxon, which is eaten locally for food in villages and traded to urban populations. There are large areas of “empty forest” in its range, especially in the west, where the habitat is intact but the animals have been hunted out (see subspecies accounts for more detail).&#160;Human populations in the range states of the taxon continue to grow&#160;at roughly 2.7% annually and this rate will not slow down for several decades (UN 2015, World Bank 2016). Road access into once-remote forests – even around protected areas – has hugely increased over the last 20-30 years (Laporte <em>et al.</em> 2007), facilitating increased hunting and transport of bushmeat for commercial trade in both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al. </em>2013, Ziegler <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, and in East Africa (including eastern DRC and Rwanda), the species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina <em>et al. </em>(2016). Historically, forest loss has been relatively low&#160;in the Gabon, CAR and Congo parts of this taxon’s range (Hansen <em>et al. </em>2013) due to low human population densities and selective (as opposed to clearcutting) logging practices. However, in Congo, Cameroon, DRC and Equatorial Guinea, forest loss in the years 2014-2016 was higher than in all previous years (from 2001) (WRI 2017; Gabon’s figures not available), and this will greatly increase in the future as industrial agriculture expands further, removing habitat suitable for various forest-obligate species (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2014).","The Grey-cheeked Mangabey is widespread, but is targeted by hunters due to its large size. The species occurs at variable densities in protected areas; density is low in unprotected forests. Studies in&#160;areas that have not been hunted in the past (Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Gabon and Kibale in Uganda) showed densities of 10–22 individuals per km². The highest density recorded (133 individuals/km²) was in Ugandan forest patches surrounded by recent cultivation.",Decreasing,"The geographic range of&#160;<em>Lophocebus albigena</em>&#160;covers approximately 1,464,100&#160;km². This is a forest-dwelling, primarily Central African taxon and occurs from Cameroon through to around 33°E, and includes Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania and most countries in the forest zone in between. Historically, the western limit of its range was the Okwangwo Forest Reserve (now part of Cross River National Park) in Nigeria, but they have not been seen there since the 1990s, nor in the adjacent Takamanda National Park in Cameroon. A very small population may survive in Nigeria’s Gashaka-Gumti National Park (based on sightings of a single individual in 2004-08). The species is found mainly south-east of the Sanaga River to its confluence with the Mbam River at about 4°30’ N, 11°6’ E&#160;in Cameroon, and then east of the Mbam through to the Nile. The southern limit is the savanna zone of southern Gabon, central Congo, and the right bank of the Congo River and the Lualaba River, Democratic Republic of Congo. The northern limit is the forest-savanna boundary at about 4°N, except in central Cameroon where it is at about 6°N in Mbam et Djerem National Park. The eastern limit is the Albertine Rift with an extension into Uganda. Its range encompasses (possibly) south-east Nigeria, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, mainland Equatorial Guinea, south-western Central African Republic, DRC, Burundi, Uganda and extreme north-western Tanzania.

Poaching of this species for the bushmeat trade is intensifying, and much of the forest in its range is now almost “empty” of large mammals. Because of its relatively large body size, the Black Mangabey is more attractive to hunters than the smaller <em>Cercopithecu</em>s monkeys with which it shares its range. The species is also threatened by habitat loss and is suspected to have declined by at least 30% over the past three generations (30 years).</p>","<p>This species is found in primary and secondary moist forests. In Salonga National Park, the Black Mangabey also uses swamp forests, but does not occupy swamp in Lomako (McGraw 1994). It uses all forest strata (especially the middle canopy layers), but seldom descends to the ground (Horn 1987, McGraw 1994). Its diet consists largely of fruits and seeds, with high rates of nectarivory in some months of the year. Foraging activity is concentrated in the early morning (Horn 1987, Gautier-Hion &amp; Maisels 1994, McGraw 1994).</p>","<p>Little is known about the status of this species. However, it is subject to intense, uncontrolled poaching for its meat in most parts of its range. It is also threatened by loss of forest habitat in the south of its range. Bushmeat data collected along the Congo River suggest that very few of these monkeys have been sold at the markets during the past decade; implying that very few are left in the forest (Laudisoit, pers. obs. late 2010s). Black Mangabeys are large-bodied, and provide more meat per unit effort than the smaller guenons (<em>Cercopithecus</em> spp.) with which they share the habitat. They are, therefore, more attractive to hunters, especially if shotguns are used (a shotgun cartridge costs about US$1 in the region). Quantitatively, a recce survey between the two sectors of the Salonga National Park in 2009 (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2009) showed that monkeys in general, and Black Mangabeys in particular, were very rare to the west of the park headquarters at Monkoto, and increasingly rare to absent at the western extreme (where the highest concentrations of people are located in the corridor). Overall encounter rate was 0.13 groups/km. A recce survey carried out at the same time and using the same survey method in the unprotected Sankuru Reserve (Liengola <em>et al</em>. 2010) recorded the species only 10 times in 400 km of survey effort – an encounter rate of only 0.025/km walked, and one-fifth of that recorded in the Salonga corridor, which was (and still is) at least partially protected by forest guards.</p>  <p>In Salonga in 2016–2017, encounter rate of groups on transects varied between 0.2 (southern sector of the park) to 0.3 (northern sector) (Wildlife Conservation Society unpublished data 2016 and 2017, Ikati <em>et al</em>. 2017), so still an order of magnitude greater than encounter rates outside the park. It is likely that most unprotected forests in the range of this species are defaunated of the larger-bodied species, including Black Mangabeys. They had completely vanished from the Swa-Kabula Reserve in the southwest of the country before 1990 (Dino 2014). The same is likely to have occurred throughout their range, especially where human populations can travel freely and rapidly through the habitat (the case in savanna-forest mosaics south of the Kasai River).</p>  <p>Rates of forest loss differ in the geographic ranges of the two subspecies. In the 130,000&#160;km²&#160;range of <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">L. a. opdenboschi, </em>about 99,500&#160;km²&#160;has forest cover (this area is the savanna-forest mosaic south of the Kasai River). A total of 3.7% of the forest cover that existed in 2001 was lost between 2001 and 2016 (GFW/WRI 2018). In <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">L. a. aterrimus </em>range, in the more closed-canopy continuous Congo Basin forests further north, the forest cover loss was only 2% during the same period – just over half of the rate of loss further south (of the subspecies' total range of 585,300&#160;km²).</p>","<p>Although <em>Lophocebus aterrimus</em><strong> </strong>is widespread, its total population size is unknown and surveys are needed. Several decades ago, densities of around 70 individuals/km² were recorded in Lomako and Lac Tumba in DRC (Horn 1987, McGraw 1994). The population is suspected to have undergone a reduction of at least 30% over the last 30 years (three generations) based on intensifying hunting pressure on this species for the bushmeat trade and habitat loss in the south of its range.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Lophocebus aterrimus&#160;</em>occurs&#160;south of the Congo River in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in lowland rainforest areas of the southwest Congo Basin. It is also found in gallery forests and more fragmented forests reaching down into northern Angola to about 8°45’ S (Gautier-Hion <em>et al.</em> 1999). The western, northern and eastern limits of the geographic range are the left bank of the Congo River. South of the Kasai River, the taxon is limited to the west by the Kwango River, and to the south by the forest-savanna boundary.</p>  <p>There are two subspecies (following Grubb <em>et al</em>. 2003): <em>L. </em><em>aterrimus<em> aterrimus</em></em> is found in the central Congo basin; <em>L. a. opdenboschi</em> is/was found in a very small area of northeastern Angola (Machado 1969, Gautier-Hion 2013), and in southwestern DRC. The two subspecies are separated by the Kasai River, which cuts diagonally across the range at roughly 3°&#160;to 4°&#160;S. The Black Mangabey was extirpated from the Swa-Kibula Reserve, a protected area on the Angolan border, before 1990 (Dino 2014).

However, further studies are required to verify the present status of its populations throughout its entire distribution range, especially in areas where the species continues to be taken for biomedical research (Brazil-Colombia-Peru border) and for illegal pet trade (north eastern Peru), and where deforestation has increased considerably during the past 10 years (Ecuador and Peru).</p>","<p> Night monkeys typically occur in primary and secondary forests (including fragmented forest and selectively logged forest), seasonally flooded and terra firme forests, and in lowland and sub-montane forests (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Aquino and Encarnación 1994a; Defler 2004; Tirira 2007; Maldonado and Peck 2014). In Ecuador, this species occurs in humid tropical forests between 200 and 900 m asl, and in subtropical forests up to 1,550 m (Tirira 2007).  </p> <p> Night monkeys are nocturnal and they are most active at dawn and dusk. During the day <em>A. vociferans</em> groups rest within holes in trees and old palms, mainly at heights of between 10-20 m. These nests are occasionally shared with other mammals (Puertas <em>et al.</em> 1995; Tirira 2007). Their diet includes fruit, nectar and flowers, leaves, and small animal prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernandez-Duque 2007).<br/> <br/> As other <em>Aotus</em> species, <em>A. vociferans</em> are socially monogamous and live in small groups of between 3 and 5 individuals, composed of an adult pair and offspring of different ages, with an average group size of 3.3 individuals (Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008; Defler 2010). Males carry infants (Rotundo <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2005). Both sexes disperse. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on the species and location) (Wright 1978, 1981; Fernandez-Duque 2007). Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> (2008) estimated a home range size of 6.3 ha for<em> A. vociferans</em> in Yasuní National Park, and observed groups ranging over their territories only at night, and more actively under a full moon.  </p> <p> The average weight of adult <em>A. vociferans</em> individuals is of 707.5 g for males and 698 g for females (Defler 2010).

However, given the actual conditions of the habitat within its distribution (large extensions of forest converted to agriculture and silvo-pasture land), it is inferred that the species has been affected (De La Torre <em>et al.</em> 2011). Furthermore, in the Napo region of Peru, deforestation along river systems is high and increasing, as is deforestation from oil exploration and exploitation, together with associated immigration.</p> <p> The long-term and systematic capture of large numbers of individuals for biomedical research in Colombia, and the release of individuals post-experimentation, are the main threats for <em>A. vociferans </em>populations in the Brazil-Colombia-Peru border. The species has not been reported in the north bank of the Amazon River in Colombia for the last seven years, where the species has been systematically taken since the early 1980’s for local malaria research (Maldonado and Peck 2014). Furthermore, Ruiz‐Garcia <em>et al.</em> (2013) and Maldonado and Peck (2014) suggested that the long term post-experimental releases of <em>A. nancymaae</em> in Colombia may have displaced wild populations of <em>A. vociferans</em> at release sites. However, long‐term population studies are required to precisely determine the current status of <em>A. vociferans</em> in the area, and to clarify the taxonomy of the genus at the Brazil-Colombia-Peru border area to allow environmental authorities to implement a management plan for local <em>A. vociferans</em> populations (Maldonado <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Ruiz-García <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>","<p> Aquino and Encarnación (1988) estimated a density of 33.0 individuals/km², and Heltne (1977) 7.9 individuals/km² in northeastern Peru.

Data summarised by FAO (2015) show that in the 1990–2015 period there was a 22.5% reduction of forest across the eight West African countries where the Olive Colobus occurs. When combined with evidence of continued heavy hunting pressure for the bushmeat trade, those data can be used to suspect at least a 30% reduction in population size in a 27-year period. The cryptic nature of the Olive Colobus, and its ability to survive in riverine forests and small forest fragments, and to adapt to some anthropogenic disturbance, have no doubt enabled the species to persist in many parts of their range. However, their decline is expected to continue in the future and, given an accelerating loss of forest habitat in West Africa (which already has one of the highest rates in the world) and continuing hunting pressure, both of which are related to continued high rates of human population growth in West Africa, <em>Procolobus verus</em> is evaluated as Vulnerable under both A2cd and A4cd.    </p><p><br/></p>","<p>This species, the smallest of all colobine monkeys, inhabits the forest zone of West Africa and is often associated with areas of secondary growth within high forest, and with swamp forests. The Olive Colobus has also been observed in forest galleries in dry forest regions. It can survive in quite small and degraded forest fragments. Olive Colobus are arboreal and most commonly occupy the lower and middle forest strata, but they will occasionally descend and move on the ground. They are cryptic in colouration and behaviour, live in small social groups, and typically associate closely with other forest monkeys, especially <em>Cercopithecus</em> species (Oates and Whitesides 1990, Nobimè and Sinsin 2003, Oates 2011, Oates and Korstjens 2013). The monkeys prefer dense growth below 20 m, but may ascend higher when feeding or moving in the company of other species. The diet of the Olive Colobus is comprised mainly of leaves and leaf parts (75-90%), especially young leaves, along with flowers and unripe seeds (Oates and Korstjens 2013).</p>","<p>This species is almost certainly declining due to loss of its forest habitats and hunting. Although the Olive Colobus can live in disturbed forests, even secondary forest is being replaced by farms and plantations in many parts of West Africa, and other species of monkey with which the Olive Colobus typically associates are being eliminated by hunting. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are among three of 10 countries in the world that had the fastest annual acceleration of tree cover loss in the 2001–2014 period, based on an analysis of satellite imagery, with Sierra Leone (once a stronghold for this species) recording the world’s second greatest annual forest loss rate of 12.6% (Petersen <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Nigeria, in the most easterly part of the species range, <em>P. verus</em> can be considered Endangered as a consequence of heavy hunting pressure and escalating habitat loss (R. Ikemeh pers. comm. 2016); data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization show a 5% per annum loss of forest cover in Nigeria in the 2010–2015 period compared with 2.7% per annum in 1990–2000 (FAO 2015).&#160;The same data analysis (FAO 2015) shows that in the eight countries in which Olive Colobus populations have been found (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo) there was a combined total forest loss in the 1990–2015 period of 22.5%. A separate analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey’s EROS Centre shows a total forest loss in the Upper Guinea region (excluding Benin and Nigeria) of 25% between 1975 and 2013 (CILSS 2016). Given the continuation of uncontrolled hunting of monkeys across much of this species’ range, it is suspected that <em>P. verus</em> has suffered a population reduction of at least 30% in the last three generations, and that this decline will accelerate in the future.</p>","<p>Although quite secretive, Olive Colobus are still present in many parts of their range; however, they have naturally low population densities (McGraw 2007) and are almost certainly declining in numbers. Surveys in Kakum Conservation Area, Ghana, in 2009–2010 encountered this species at a lower rate than reported from surveys in 1993 (Wiafe 2016). Surveys in southwestern Ghana in 2012 reported its presence in the forest reserves of Krokosua Hills, Ayum, Subin, Bia North, Mpameso, Bia-Tano and Bokoni, at encounter rates of between 0.03 and 0.13 groups per km, and in Bia National Park at 0.23 groups per km (Danquah <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Côte d’Ivoire, recent surveys reported the presence of the species in several protected and unprotected areas, but at very low densities (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Côte d’Ivoire the most important populations occur in the Tanoé Forest and in Taï National Park, where estimated densities are 1.9 groups per sq. km (S. Gonedelé Bi pers. obs. 2009) and 2.65 groups per&#160;km²&#160;(Covey 2009) respectively. In the 1980s, the density in secondary and riverine forest at Tiwai Island, Sierra Leone, was 1.2 groups per&#160;km²&#160;(Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990). A recent survey of Benin found them to have a more widespread distribution than previously known (Djego-Djossou <em>et al</em>. 2014), but with a small total population; none were observed during a 2015 survey in neighbouring Togo (G. Segniagbeto pers. comm. 2016).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Olive Colobus is confined to the forests of West Africa, and is discontinuously distributed from southern Sierra Leone and Guinea to south-east Nigeria (Oates 1981, 2011).

Human population growth in the range states continues at roughly 2.7% annually and will not slow down for several decades (United Nations 2015, WorldPop 2016). Road access into once-remote forests – even around protected areas – has hugely increased over the last 20–30 years (Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007), facilitating hunting and transportation of bushmeat to both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>Although this taxon may be the most resistant of the arboreal monkeys to hunting pressure, it is less tolerant to forest disturbance (Oates 2011, Gautier-Hion 2013). In West Africa, and in much of Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, the species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. (2016). In the Cameroon (SE), CAR, DRC, Congo and Gabon portions of this taxon’s range, forest loss is relatively low (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013), due to historically lower human population densities and selective logging, as opposed to clear-cutting, practised in the region. However, forest loss in the most recent year available (2014) was higher than in all previous years (from 2001) in Cameroon, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, DRC and Equatorial Guinea, and in Gabon, Guinea and Liberia this was true for 2013, followed by 2014 (World Resources Institute 2016).

In West Africa, it is relatively rare. In Côte d’Ivoire, it is likely restricted to Taï National Park, where it has a density of 0.05 groups/km² (0.45 individuals/km²; Buzzard and Eckardt 2007). In Liberia, its population status is unknown. In southwestern Nigeria, encounter rates have declined significantly due mainly to forest conversion and excessive hunting. For example, in 2009 encounter rates of 1.18–3.12 groups/km were recorded, but in 2013, the encounter rate had decreased to 0.06–0.16 groups per km surveyed (Ikemeh 2009, 2013).

The primary drivers of these threats—human population growth and the expansion of artisanal mining—are likely to increase into the foreseeable future. Most of the species’ range is in a region of endemic and ongoing human conflict, which has exacerbated known threats, and weakened organised efforts to protect these primates. It is suspected that the population decline of <em>C. hamlyni</em> will continue, resulting in an overall population reduction of more than 30% over a 30-year time frame from 2003 to 2033 (given a 10-year generation length).

In the lowland forest zone (450–1,000 m), which comprises the major portion of the range, <em>C. hamlyni</em> occurs mainly in primary forest areas. The species occupies older secondary forest in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, but does not favour young secondary forests, and is not known to occur in gallery forests in savannas at the southern limit of its range (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013). The isolated forest blocks south of the species’ contiguous EOO, where <em>C. hamlyni</em> have been recorded historically, range in size from 200–450&#160;km²&#160;and are located on small chains of hills. There is no evidence that these blocks were isolated due to historic human activities, and they may represent relictual range areas, isolated by climate-induced habitat change during the Quaternary or Holocene. In any case, they suggest that isolated populations of <em>C. hamlyni</em> may be able to persist even in a fragmented landscape. Further investigation of the current status of these populations, and exploration of other isolated forest massifs in this region for presence of the species is urgently needed.</p>  <p>Mean group size in the Kahuzi-Biega lowlands and Ituri Forest is 2–3 animals (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2002-2003), In Nyungwe National Park group size averaged 3.6 animals (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). These estimates are based on sightings of animals from line transects. However, given the difficulties of directly observing these monkeys, this may be an underestimate of group size. The species feeds primarily on the ground. Diet is poorly documented but known to include fruits and seeds. In the Ituri Forest (elevation 700–750 m) <em>C. hamlyni</em> forages opportunistically on sprouting seedlings when&#160;<em>Gilbertiondendron dewevrei</em>&#160;undergoes&#160;<a style=""mso-comment-reference:eaw_1;mso-comment-date:20180408T1956"">mast</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;fruiting.

The Nyungwe population feeds extensively on bamboo shoots, and this is likely to be the case in other montane locations such as Kahuzi-Biega and Mt. Tshiaberimu, where the species occurs in the bamboo zones. Given the range of habitats occupied<em>, C. hamlyn</em>i appears to have a wide dietary tolerance with specialization based on local and seasonal food availability.</p><p><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Leopards and crowned eagles are known to prey on<em> C. hamlyni</em> in the Ituri Forest; nonetheless, the species was recorded at a low frequency in one study of leopard diets (Hart <em>et al</em>. 1996).</span></p>","<p>This species is threatened by habitat loss and poaching. Habitat loss and degradation, due primarily to deforestation by shifting cultivators and small holder farmers, is the most significant threat at present and is growing rapidly. Forest loss in DRC increased by a factor of 2.5 between 2011 and 2017 (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss and associated degradation have been particularly intense in the eastern and southern portions of <em>C. hamlyni’s</em> range. The impact is most severe in the submontane and montane portions of the range, where human population densities are highest.</p>  <p>Factors promoting habitat loss include rural population growth and expansion of artisanal mining. These will continue to prevail into the foreseeable future. Within the range of <em>C. hamlyni</em>, high rates of forest loss are particularly evident around growing settlements of Beni, Kalima, Kindu, Kisangani, Lubutu, Mambasa,&#160;Opienge and Punia. Deforestation and forest degradation are expanding along networks of abandoned roads emanating from these centres, leading to fragmentation of previously intact forest blocks. East of Kisangani, and in the peripheries of Kahuzi-Biega and Maiko national parks, large roadless forest blocks have been invaded by artisanal miners leading to new clearings in remote areas. A recent deforestation hotspot analysis (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017) indicates that about 40% of <em>C. hamlyni</em> range has been affected by moderate to severe forest loss and degradation. Vast areas of newly-emerging deforestation hot spots intersect with intact primary forests and extend into several protected areas (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>For the past two decades, eastern DRC has been the theatre of entrenched conflict promulgated by a multiplicity of rural militia, a number of whom are based in national parks. The militia attack and loot villages, and exploit artisanal mining or are involved in it themselves. The conflict has led to large movements of internally displaced people (IDPs) and has contributed to the opening of new settlements and expansion of existing settlements. In 2017, over 850,00 unsettled IDPs were registered in administrative territories within the geographic range of <em>C. hamlyni</em> (UNOCHA 2018).</p>  <p>Expanding settlement and artisanal mining are associated with increased hunting and poaching. <em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is shy and difficult to detect. Although this species is not a frequent target of hunters, its terrestrial habits make it vulnerable to snares set for other species. A recent survey of bushmeat market vendors in Kalima, a mining centre in the southern portion of its range, revealed only one fresh <em>C. hamlyni</em> carcass among 38 primates (dried and fresh) on sale. According to vendors interviewed, as recently as five years ago, they could expect to offer 3–5 fresh <em>C. hamlyni</em> per day. Four hunters in three villages to the south and west of Kalima, bordering the region’s remaining forest areas, stated that snare captures of <em>C. hamlyni </em>have been declining for the past 15 years, and are now uncommon. (J. Hart unpublished data 2018).</p>","<p><em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is widespread and variably abundant. Important populations have been documented in the lowland sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, with densities of 5-7 individuals per km² (Hall <em>et al. </em>2002-2003) and the species persists throughout this park (Kujirakwinja <em>et al. </em>2015; Spira <em>et al. </em>2015a, 2015b, 2017). Populations surveyed at montane sites at the species’ altitudinal limit appear to be small. In Nyungwe Nation al Park, encounter rates&#160;averaged 0.08 groups/km (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). <em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is a cryptic and quiet species, which is difficult to census and characteristically moves away from observers before detection, therefore population estimates based on visual contact probably underestimate population sizes. Surveys at dawn in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve of “booming” male vocalisations suggest that <em>C. hamlyni</em> is locally common, and that this is a stronghold for the species (J. Hart, unpublished data 2012). Methods&#160;appropriate for estimating&#160;<em>C. hamlyni</em>&#160;population size, such as camera trap surveys, show&#160;promise (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011), but have not yet been conducted.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>The range of&#160;<em>Cercopithecus</em>&#160;<em>hamlyni </em>resembles that of <em>Allochrocebus lhoesti</em>, with a continuous EOO from the Congo/Lualaba River in the west, through the forested basins of the Lindi, Ituri, Maiko, Lowa, Ulindi and Elila rivers in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the bulk of the range falls, into the submontane and montane forests of the Albertine Rift, where a small portion of the range is located. The range is bounded in the north by the Lindi-Nepoko river system and in the south by the southern limit of tropical moist forest (about 4° S). The only known population outside DRC occurs in an area of about 32 km² in Rwanda's Nyungwe National Park (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). A second Rwandan population in Gishwati is now likely extirpated due to habitat loss (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013). Historically, populations of <em>C. hamlyni</em> have been reported from several small, isolated forest blocks, south to nearly 6° S (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013); however, its current status in these areas is unknown. The eastern-most highland populations of <em>C. hamlyni </em>are now isolated in fragmented habitat islands, some of which have been recently extirpated, such as the forest islands between Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Masisi. The species has not been reported from areas of Burundi adjoining the Nyungwe population and its possible former occurrence in Uganda is not supported by museum specimens.</p><p></p>  <p>We estimate that the species’ elevational range extends from 450 m, where C. hamlyni has recently been recorded east of Kindu, 40 km from the Congo/Lualaba River&#160;(Hart pers. obs. 2018), to 3,200 m on Mt.

It is likely that there has been a decline in the order of 20-25% over the past 27 years. This decline is expected to continue, and so this species almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A2cd.</p>","<em>Cercopithecus pogonias </em>is found in primary lowland rainforest and submontane rainforest up to around 1,700 m (Bioko). These monkeys are mostly frugivorous: 60–87% of the diet is fruits and seeds; they also eat a smaller proportion of leaves, flowers and insects (Gautier-Hion 2013). Mean group size in an unhunted area of Lopé National Park in Gabon was 12.6, and biomass was 11 kg/km²&#160;(Tutin <em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"">et al</em>. 1997b). Mean group size in nearby Makandé was reported to be 14 individuals (Brugière 1998), but 12.2 (± 3.2) individuals in a subsequent study (Brugière 2005). The taxon is usually found with other monkey species (Gautier-Hion 2013) and prefers the upper strata of the forest above 20–25 m. Group size is 8–20 individuals.","<p>The major direct threats to <em>C. pogonias</em> are hunting and habitat degradation. Humans are the primary predator (Gautier-Hion 2013) and monkeys&#160;are eaten locally in villages or traded commercially for consumption in towns and cities. The indirect threats are increasing human populations, agricultural expansion and&#160;logging activities, which create easy access routes into previously remote forests. Human populations in the range states of this taxon are growing at roughly 2.7% annually and this rate will not slow down for several decades (UN 2015, World Bank 2017). Road access into once-remote forests—even around protected areas—has increased hugely during the last 20–30 years (Laporte&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007), facilitating hunting and transport of bushmeat to both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Ziegler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>The species is affected by habitat modification across parts of its range, especially in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo, DRC and Cabinda, as intact high forest, in which the species is most abundant, is converted to farmland and “farm bush” (see Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. 2016). Forest loss in the species range is much less evident in Gabon. Forest loss in the most recent year available (2014) was higher than in all previous years (from 2001) in Congo, DRC and Equatorial Guinea, and in Gabon this was true for 2013, followed by 2014 (WRI 2016). Deforestation will greatly increase in the future as industrial agriculture expands, removing the habitat of various forest-obligate species.</p>","Data on&#160;<em>Cercopithecus pogonias</em>&#160;abundance are sparse. The species had the lowest biomass of all primates at Lopé in Gabon (Tutin <em>et al.</em> 1997a). Data from well-studied sites range from 9–11 kg/km²&#160;to 115 kg/km²&#160;and densities of 4–48 individuals/km²&#160;(Gautier-Hion 2013), with the lowest densities at the savanna-forest ecotone (Tutin <em>et al. </em>1997a). The Bioko population is estimated at just 4,500 animals (in 369&#160;km²), giving a rough population density of 12 individuals/km², so at the low end of the scale for the species (Cronin<em> et al.</em> 2015, Cronin, unpublished data 2016). Further details can be found in the subspecies accounts.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Cercopithecus pogonias</em> has a large range, estimated to cover about 1,108,230&#160;km² of&#160;moist tropical forest and forest-savanna mosaic. It is found in Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea (including the island of Bioko), Gabon and the Cabinda enclave of Angola. Hicks (2010) found that the species was abundant in Bili-Uéré, north of the Rubi River up to the border with CAR (Mbomu River). The northern limit of its distribution is probably the limit of high canopy forest to the north, between about 4° and 6° N, although some parts of the historic range are a little further north and are now degraded forest (if the species is still present). As far as is known, the eastern limit is at about 26° E. and then the right (north) bank of the Itimbiri River in DRC and the right (north) bank of the Congo River, down to the forest-savanna limits in Congo. It may overlap or abut with the distribution of <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">Cercopithecus denti</em>, but there is a lack of information from the possible overlap zone (Sarmiento and Kingdon 2013) and Hicks (2010) saw only <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">C. denti</em> in the bushmeat markets between the Uélé and Rubi Rivers (forest identifications could potentially have been confused with the very similar <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">C. denti</em>). To the southwest, it is possible that this species occurs all the way to the Congo estuary where suitable habitat remains and hunting pressure is low.&#160;</p><p>Historically, this species was found in Cameroon (Takamanda National Park) at about 9.3° E; however, the most recent surveys in Takamanda (Ikfuingei and Kuchambi 2013) and Dimonika Reserve in Congo (Latour 2010) did not record it, so we must assume it is already extirpated or has become extremely rare in this region. Recent surveys across the Cross River region in Nigeria did not record&#160;<em>C. pogonias</em>&#160;(Imong <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">et al</em>. 2009), so the Cameroon-Nigeria border area is likely the present western limit.</p><p>There are three subspecies. The distribution of the nominate subspecies, <em>C. p. pogonias</em> is a little unclear. Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>.

However, Groves (2001) reports&#160;<em>C. p. pogonias</em> as occurring from the Cross River across the Sanaga River to Río Muni, and includes Bioko. In the current treatment,&#160;<em>C. p. pogonias</em>&#160;includes the animals on Bioko (<em>ca</em> 2,000&#160;km²) and on mainland Africa in the moist forest region between Cross River State, Nigeria, where the Sanaga River in Cameroon marks its southeastern distribution limit (Oates 2011), totalling over 50,000&#160;km².</p><p><em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"">Cercopithecus p. nigripes</em> is found in Congo, Gabon and Cabinda.

Nationally, it is on the list of partially protected species in Nigeria (Federal Ministry of Nigeria 2004). Hunting, sale and consumption of primates in Equatorial Guinea were banned by Presidential Decree in October 2007 (Republic of Equatorial Guinea 2007), although no specific taxon is mentioned in that law. In DRC, <em>C. pogonias</em> is on the partially-protected list (may be hunted with a permit) (Enerunga 2006). In Congo, it is on Annex III of the current law (“all animals not on Annexes I or II”), meaning that it can be hunted for food, but only using traditional methods, and not for commerce, transport away from the site where it was hunted (in other words to a different village or other area), and trafficking products of the species on Annex III are strictly prohibited (MEFDD 2011). Similarly, they are on Class C (may be hunted with a permit) in Cameroon and CAR (Central African Republic 1984, MINFOF 2006).</p>  <p>Hunting is banned in all national parks where <em>C. pogonias</em> occurs so, on paper at least, the species is protected in those areas. However, weak application of and poor compliance with the law outside protected areas (and inside some PAs) results in gun-hunting through most of its range. The taxon occurs in many protected areas including three World Heritage Sites: Lopé-Okanda (Gabon), the Sangha Trinational (Cameroon-CAR-Congo) and the Dja Biosphere Reserve (Cameroon).</p><p>The species' strongholds (in terms of large areas of suitable habitat and abundance of individuals) are in the forests of Gabon, especially the protected areas, plus the Dzanga-Sangha complex in CAR, the protected areas of southeastern Cameroon, and the national parks of Conkouati-Douli, Nouabalé-Ndoki and Odzala in Congo. Outside protected areas, these monkeys are likely to be increasingly rare, especially in areas with medium-to-high human population density and active logging.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
166617312,40019,Cebus kaapori,Critically Endangered,A2acd+3cd+4acd,2020,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,This species is listed as Critically Endangered due to a drastic population reduction over the past three generations (48 years). During this period it is estimated that the population has been reduced by at least 80% due both to deforestation and to hunting for bushmeat. Lopes and Ferrari (1993) and Ferrari and Queiroz (1994) concluded that <em>Cebus kaapori</em> is one of the most threatened of all the Amazonian primates. More recently the species was considered one of the most threatened primate species in the world (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 2012). A further decline at the same rate is expected to affect this species over the next three generations.,"<em>Cebus kaapori</em> occurs in dense rain forest and deciduous forest environments of Eastern Amazonia. The taxon is not restricted to primary habitats, but it is not tolerant to changes/disturbance in its environment. Recent records from areas close to the coast at Pará State suggest that <em>C. kaapori</em> also uses stretches of mangroves and estuarine floodplain (Silva Jr. <em>et al</em>. 2009, Silva Jr. <em>et al.</em> 2010). Groups observed by Carvalho Jr <em>et al.</em> (1999) ranged in size from 1 to 7 individuals. The species is described as essentially frugivorous, supplementing their diet with arthropods and seeds. In the only study that followed a group throughout the dry season, at the Tucuruí hydroelectric scheme, Goianésia do Pará, the animals used their time mostly ranging (47.4%), feeding (24%) and foraging (15.3%). Time spent resting was only 9%, which is very low for gracile capuchin monkeys, suggesting a dietary stress for this group (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2014).&#160; In the same study, 74% of feeding records were of fruit intake, 13% of insects and 10% of seeds (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2014). The capuchins showed a preference for seven plant species in the study site: <em>Inga alba, Bellucia grossularioides, Attalea maripa, Alchorneopis floribunda, Gustavia augusta, Apeiba burchellii, </em>and <em>Bactris maraja</em> (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; They also ate caterpillars, ants, snails, spiders, wasp nests, honeycombs, and also an unidentified rodent (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014). This group used 62 ha, and traveled for an average of 2.1 km/day (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014). They used open ombrophylic forest, as well as secondary vegetation, acai palm forest, and riparian forest (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014). This study remains the only one to describe in detail the aspects of the natural history of the species (Oliveira 2011; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2014). Oliveira<em> et al. </em>(2014) found significant dietary overlap between <em>C. kaapori</em> and <em>Sapajus</em> (the robust capuchin), suggesting that sympatric competition with robust capuchins may exacerbate the risk of extinction for <em>C. kaapori</em> in the highly fragmented and anthropogenically disturbed habitats where both remain.<br/><br/><strong>Size: </strong><br/>Paratype. Adult male HB 46.5 cm, TL 51.0 cm, 3.05 kg (Queiroz 1982).","The major threat for the species is habitat loss, as its forests in southern Pará and Maranhão have been extensively destroyed over the last 30 years. It is the region with the highest human population density and the highest level of deforestation and habitat degradation in the entire Brazilian Amazon (Carvalho Jr. <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Gurupí Biological Reserve is the only protected area where the species is known to occur, but the reserve has lost more than half of its forests. Lopes (1993) concluded that selective logging was particularly prejudicial to <em>Cebus kaapori</em> due to the loss of trees providing fruits that are a significant component of its diet. The species is also hunted in the area. Guajá indians also keep them as pets (Queiroz 1992).","Carvalho, Jr. <em>et al.</em> (1999) observed group sizes ranging from 2 to 7 individuals. Oliveira <em>et al. </em>(2014) studied a group of nine individuals in the area of influence of the Tucurui hydroelectric dam.&#160; All field observations and previous abundance estimates suggest low densities for all studied sites, For instance, in Rebio Gurupí, Maranhão, it was found 0.06 groups/10 km (Lopes 1993); in Ranch Cauaxi, Paragominas, Pará, 0.99 groups/10 km or 5.49 ind./10km (Carvalho Jr. <em>et al.</em> 1999); in Ranch Amanda, Viseu, Pará, 0.28 sightings/10 km (Pereira 2002) and in Rio Capim, Goianésia, Pará 0.16-0.19 groups/10 km (Camargo<em> et al.</em> 2007). Lopes (1993) detected three groups in a 480 km survey inside the Gurupí Biological Reserve. Twenty years afterwards, Buss <em>et al. </em>(2014) found 0.25 groups/10 km. Densities estimates for the species in Rebio Gurupí, Maranhão, were also recorded from 0.2 to 0.98 ind./km² (Ferrari and Lopes 1996, Lopes and Ferrari 1996).<br/>The remaining total population size is not known, and neither is it known if the number of mature individuals of this species is greater than 10,000. Campos (2009) showed that only three of the known populations would be viable in the long term (100 years).",Decreasing,"<em>Cebus kaapori</em> is endemic to Brazil, occurring in the States of Maranhão and Pará. Its distribution area coincides with the Belém centre of endemism, and its type locality is the Garimpo Chega-tudo, Carutapera, Maranhão (Queiroz 1992). The coordinates originally published for the type locality have recently been updated and corrected to 02°20'S; 46°05'W by the same author. The species is distributed between the right bank of the lower Rio Tocantins to the east edge of the Amazonian biome, near Zona dos Cocais (Queiroz 1992, Ferrari and Queiroz 1994, Ferrari and Souza Jr 1994, Ferrari and Lopes 1996, Silva, Jr. and Cerqueira 1998, Carvalho, Jr. <em>et al.</em> 1999, Cunha <em>et al.</em> 2007, Fialho <em>et. al.</em> 2015). Interviews about the past and present occurrence of<em> C. kaapori</em> suggest that the southern limit of the species lies close to 5º20'S (Fialho<em> et al</em>. 2015).",This species is used as food by humans and live animals as a pets.,Terrestrial,"This species is recorded at the Gurupí Biological Reserve (272,379 ha) (Queiroz 1992) and Lago de Tucuruí State Environmental Protection Area (568,667 ha) (Cunha<em> et al.</em> 2007). It is listed on CITES Appendix II. Only three populations are viable and need all the support to ensure the perpetuation of the species. This support involves the regularization of Gurupí Biological Reserve, monitoring of indigenous lands and compliance to the environmental legislation. The three potentially viable populations are 1) that found in the forest continuum formed by the Gurupí Biological Reserve and Awá, Caru and Alto-Turiaçu indigenous lands, 2) the Araribóia indigenous land and 3) the forest continuum among municipalities of Goianésia do Pará, Ulianópolis and Tomé Açu, at Pará State.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

There is what would appear to be a natural hybrid zone with <em>Callithrix flaviceps</em>, at the Serra do Brigadeiro, Carangola, in south-eastern Minas Gerais (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al.</em> 1993, Cosenza 1993, Cosenza and Melo 1998).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from other Neotropical primates by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth on either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging tree trunks and branches (and vines of certain species), to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet (Coimbra-Filho 1972, Rylands 1984). They live in extended family groups of 4 to 15 individuals. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. Brandão (1999) recorded a home range size of 39.9 ha (extending as high as 1,350 m asl) for one group at the Bananal Ecological Station, São Paulo.<br/><br/>The ecology and behaviour of <em>C. aurita</em> was studied by Muskin (1984a,b; Martins 1998a,b; Martins and Setz 2000; Santos and Martins 2000) in southern Minas Gerais and by Brandão (1999) and Brandão and Devely (1998) at the Bananal State Ecological Station in Brazil. Corrêa (1995), Ferrari <em>et al</em>. (1996), Corrêa <em>et al.</em> (2000), Coutinho (1996) and Coutinho and Corrêa (1995) studied the behavioural ecology of the species at the Núcleo Cunha of the Serra do Mar State Park in São Paulo, Brazil. Coutinho (1996) studied particularly the social and reproductive behaviour.<br/><br/>The dentition of<em> Callithrix aurita</em> is less specialized for tree-gouging to obtain gum than it is in <em>C. jacchus</em> and <em>C. penicillata</em> (see Natori 1986). Despite this, gum is an important part of their diet all year round, and largely obtained from sites where it is available without requiring gouging (Muskin 1984a, b; Coimbra-Filho 1991; Corrêa 1995; Ferrari <em>et al.</em> 1996; Martins and Setz 2000). Martins (2000) recorded them foraging on army ant (Eciton burchelli) swarms. Notable for this species is its consumption of fungi, otherwise recorded only in <em>Callimico goeldii.</em> They find the fruiting bodies of fungi on the stems of bamboo species (<em>Merostachys</em> spp.) and the South American mountain bamboo (<em>Chusquea</em> spp.), both of the family Poaceae.<br/>Size:Female weight: 400-450 g (Garber 1992); Male weight: 400-450 g (Garber 1992)","The widespread destruction of forests within this marmoset's range, especially along the valley of the Rio Paraiba and in the lowland forests is a major threat to this species (Coimbra-Filho 1986b; Brandão and Develey 1998). It might still remain in some areas of the lowland forest of Rio de Janeiro (Mambucaba, Angra dos Reis), but is considered extinct in lowland forests of São Paulo State (Brandão and Develey 1998). <br/><br/><em>Callithrix aurita</em> faces competition from other invasive marmosets (Pereira 2006, 2010, Melo and Rylands 2008, Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2008, Port-Carvaho and Kierulff 2009, Nogueira <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bechara 2012,&#160; Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2013, Carvalho 2015, Melo <em>et al.</em> 2015, Nunes 2015, Goncalves 2016), as well as hybridization with several of its congeners (Pereira 2010, Nogueira <em>et al</em>. 2011, Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2013, Carvalho 2015). <br/><br/>The species is sometimes captured for the pet trade. <br/><br/>It is possible that introduced <em>Callithrix jacchus</em> and<em> Callithrix penicillata </em>have competed, and are still competing with and displacing this species, particularly in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Many non-native <em>Callithrix</em> are also interbreeding with <em>C. aurita</em> resulting in hybridization, although the extent of this threat needs further investigation.In the state of Rio de Janeiro, these threats are considered quite intense. Based on studies by Pereira (2006, 2010) and Pereira <em>et al</em>. (2008),<em> C. aurita</em> is certainly at a critical stage of extinction risk, especially due to the introduction of <em>C. penicillata</em>, <em>C. jacchus</em> and <em>Callithrix hybrids</em> into protected areas where <em>C. aurita</em> occurs.In the state of São Paulo, the risk of hybridization and competition with exotic, invasive species is also extremely worrying, but there is still no accurate diagnosis of the current situation. In the Serra da Cantareira, invaders and hybrids are both present particularly in the area surrounding PE Cantareira, a situation that did not prevail 10 years ago (M. Port-Carvalho, unpubl. data).","<em>Callithrix aurita</em> is nowhere common, and populations in the National Parks of Bocaina and Serra dos Orgãos are small (Coimbra-Filho 1984). Nine months of surveys in the Carlos Botelho State Park in the Serra do Paranapiacaba, in the south of its range, failed to provide any evidence for the survival of this marmoset (Paccagnella 1991; see also Torres de Assumpção 1983). Although recorded as rare in the Itatiaia National Park by Ávila-Pires and Gouveia (1977), Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. (1982) reported it to be extinct there. It may still occur in much reduced numbers according to Coimbra-Filho (1986b). It is extremely rare in the private reserve of the Fazenda Barreiro Rico (3,259 ha of forest), São Paulo. Milton and Lucca (1984) estimated no more than 8-12 animals in the entire area.<br/><br/>Other recorded density estimates include: 15 individuals/km² at the Fazenda Barreiro Rico, São Paulo (Torres de Assumpção 1983); 0.02-0.08 individuals/km² in the Rio Doce State Park, Minas Gerais (Stallings and Robinson 1991); and 20-23 individuals/km² in the Serra do Mar State Park (esp. Núcleo Cunha), São Paulo (Corrêa 1995). Currently, it is estimated that the size of the remaining total population is 176 subpopulations (Bechara 2012), with the number of mature individuals of this taxon being greater than 10,000. The species has suffered severe population decline, due to the loss and fragmentation of their habitat, as demonstrated by Bechara (2012), which showed a reduction of approximately 43% in this marmoset's area of occupancy (AOO) within 18 years. The population decline estimated for the species is intensified by competition and hybridization with invasive species, like <em>C. penicillata</em> and<em> C. jacchus</em>, and hybrids of the genus <em>Callithrix</em>. Thus, it is suspected that the reduction of <em>C. aurita</em> populations is at least 50% over the last 18 years.",Decreasing,"<em>Callithrix aurita</em> occurs in the montane rain forests of  south-eastern Brazil, in the southern part of the state of Minas Gerais,  the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the East and North-east of the state  of São Paulo (see Coimbra-Filho 1986b, Olmos and Martuscelli 1995,  Brandão and Develey 1998, Ferrari<em> et al</em>. 1996). Hershkovitz  (1977) marks the northern limit in Minas Gerais as the Rio Muriaé, but  it occurs to the north in the Rio Doce State Park in Minas Gerais  (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 1982), and hybrids (with <em>C. flaviceps</em>)  have been recorded at Carangola in the Serra do Brigadeiro, Minas  Gerais (Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Mendes 1997a,d; Cosenza and Melo 1998).  Melo and Rylands (2008) described the geographical distribution of this  taxon. The northern boundary of its distribution seems to be the  Piracicaba River, in Minas Gerais; the southern limit is the river Doce.  In the West, it seems to extend to Espinhaço in Minas Gerais, and to  the transition areas of the Cerrado in São Paulo. To the East, in Rio de  Janeiro, the species is limited to the tops of the slopes of the Serra  do Mar, with the exception of the southern state, where <em>C. aurita</em>  can be found almost at sea level.Its southern boundary is still  unknown, because the great mass of Paranapiacaba in Sao Paulo can house  relict populations, as well as <em>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em> (Lima <em>et al.</em>  2003). Hershkovitz (1977) indicated the south-easternmost locality to  be the Rio Ribeira de Iguapé in São Paulo. However, Olmos and  Martuscelli (1995) failed to find evidence for this. They reported that  extensive fieldwork (1982-1995) in such localities as the Fazenda  Intervales State Park, Alto Ribeira State Park, Ilha do Cardoso and  Carlos Botelho, and the Jureia Ecological Station and the muncipalities  of Juquitiba amd Miracatú in the Serra da Paranapicaba consistently  failed to find <em>C. aurita</em>. They proposed the southern limit to  be near the city of São Paulo, north of the junction of the Rios  Pinheiros and Tietê. The Rio Tieté forms the southernmost boundary and  the most southerly record is close to Ipanema (23º26’S, 47º36’W), today  Araçoiaba da Serra (the type locality for<em> Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em>).  From there it extends west between the upper reaches of the Rios  Tieté/Piracicaba. Again the exact limits are unclear, but believed to be  the junction of these two rivers (Olmos and Martusecelli 1995).<br/><br/>Brandão and Develey (1998) carried out surveys to better understand the range of <em>C. aurita</em>.  Although generally believed to be largely montane in its range  (600-1,200 m asl) according to Olmos and Martuscelli (1995), and  (500-800 m asl) according to Rylands (1994), museum specimens have been  collected on the foothills of the Serra do Mar, south of Rio de Janeiro  (Pedra Blanca, municipality of Paratí at 80 m asl, and Mambucaba,  municipality of Angra dos Reis at 100 m asl; Brandão and Develey 1998).  Coimbra-Filho (1991) and Mendes (1993) also indicated that it occurred  elsewhere in lowland Rio de Janeiro, including the North-east, but is  probably today extinct there. All recent records are montane. Brandão  and Develey (1998) carried out extensive surveys of the lowland coastal  forests of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and were unable to obtain  evidence of the species’ existence anywhere except at Mambucaba where  they found one in captivity and observed a group at 165 m asl.<br/><br/>This  marmoset has been recorded north of the Rio Paraíba do Sul at the  following sites: Mogi-Guaçú (Rio Mogi-Guaçú) by R. A. Mittermeier  (unpubl.) and Muskin (1984); Alfenas, upper Rio Grande, in Minas Gerais  (Hershkovitz 1977, Muskin 1984a); Vargem Grande, São Paulo (Muskin  1984a); Fazenda Monte Alegre, Monte Belo, Minas Gerais (Muskin 1984a)  and in the vicinity of Viçosa, Minas Gerais (Mendes 1993); Serra do  Capanema, Rio de Janeiro (21º03’S, 42º03’W) (Mendes 1993), Fazenda João  Abdo, Rio de Janeiro (21º27’S, 41º56’W) (Mendes 1993). The westernmost  locality shown by Hershkovitz (1977) is Boracéia, north-east of Bauru,  on the upper Rio Tieté (22°10'S, 48°45'W), but Olmos and Martuscelli  (1995) found this to be an outlier and suggested that this locality  actually refers to the Boracéia Biological Station near the headwaters  of the Rio Tietê.Recent <em>C. aurita</em> records have been published, in the northwest of the state of Rio de Janeiro (Bergallo <em>et al</em>.  2009a,b;. D. Pereira, unpubl. data) and in enclaves of Cerrado in São  Paulo and in the southern and southeastern areas of Minas Gerais  (Bechara 2012). More samples to define the southern distributional limit  are required. Regions such as the great mass of Paranapiacaba and the  south bank of the Tiete River in Sao Paulo are areas of potential local  occurrence of this taxon (Melo and Rylands 2008).<br/><em></em>",The species is sometimes captured for the pet trade.,Terrestrial,"<em>Callithrix aurita</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES.

Calls of what are believed to be this animal were heard in early 2008, but no wild animal has been seen by an experienced field-worker for 40 years. Therefore this monkey is regarded as possibly extinct. Its disappearance from its former range in the forests of eastern Côte d’Ivoire and western Ghana was almost certainly caused by excessive hunting for the bushmeat trade, combined with a loss of mature forest habitat.</p>","<p>Miss Waldron’s Red Colobus was restricted to tropical moist and semi-deciduous forest, and swamp forest, where it typically used the upper canopy (Martin 1991). Two groups studied in Bia National Park in Ghana in the 1970s comprised 34 and 58 individuals, had home ranges of 100–140 ha, and had a diet consisting predominantly of leaves but also fruits, seeds and flowers (Martin 1991).</p>","<p>The major causes of the decline of the species were hunting and habitat loss (Oates <em>et al</em>. 2000). Both subsistence and commercial hunting (for the bushmeat trade) heavily impacted populations of this species, and improved access to forest interiors via logging roads increased hunting pressure. Deforestation through logging, charcoal production, cocoa farming and clearance for agricultural land (including industrial oil palm and rubber tree plantations), occurred over much of the species range in the last 50-60 years.</p>","<p>There have been no confirmed sightings of Miss Waldron's Red Colobus in the wild since 1978 and surveys carried out from 1993 to the present have failed to produce a sighting of living individuals (Oates <em>et al.</em> 2000, McGraw 2005, Oates 2011). The last evidence for the survival of a small population came from the Tanoé Swamp Forest between the Ehy lagoon and the Tanoé River in extreme south-eastern Côte d'Ivoire (McGraw and Oates 2002, McGraw 2005, Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2008), near which a skin was found in possession of a hunter in 2002 and where calls by what is believed to be Miss Waldron's Red Colobus were heard in March 2008 by a team of scientists from the <em>Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Côte d’Ivoire</em> (I.

Its numbers were declining in Ghana 60 years ago, when Booth (1956) predicted its extinction in the near future.

In Odzala-Kokoua National Park in Congo, they use seasonally-inundated and riverine habitats and occasionally the Marantaceae-dominated terra firma forests (Maisels 1995, 1996). In the area east of Makokou in Gabon, they were found in riverine forests (Quris 1975). By contrast, a study group at Mondika in CAR spent most of its time in terra firma mixed forest, and was never observed along the Mondika River, nor in swamp forest along the Ndoki River (Shah 2003), whereas a group at Bai Hokou, also in CAR, spent some time along rivers and streams (N. Shah pers. obs. 2003). <em>Cercocebus agilis</em><strong> </strong>also uses open-understorey <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei </em>dominated forest (Shah 2003, Devreese 2011). In the north of its range, the species will use the gallery forests in savanna-forest mosaics of northern CAR (Fay 1988), and in the east (e.g., Okapi Wildlife Reserve), it uses terra firma forests, but will sometimes forage on crops (Kambale Saambere 1999). These monkeys are usually active in lower strata (0–10 m) of the habitat (Quris 1975, Shah 2003), although they spend less time on the ground than other <em>Cercocebus</em> spp. (Shah 2003). Home-range size was estimated to be ca 3&#160;km²&#160;in Dzanga-Sangha in CAR (Shah 2003), and 2&#160;km²&#160;in Gabon (Quris 1975).</p><p>Agile Mangabeys have strong dietary preferences for fruit, seeds and monocotyledon shoots, and can bite through the hard shells of some fruits, such as <em>Strychnos </em>(Shah 2003). They also prey on animals up to the size of infant Peters’ Duikers (Knights <em>et al</em>. 2008, Shah 2013).<br/><br/>In CAR, mean group size was 21 at Mondika, but a habituated group at nearby Bai Hokou numbered 135 animals, and on occasion it reached 330 individuals (Devreese <em>et al</em>. 2013). In northeastern Gabon, group size ranged between 8 and 18 (Quris 1975). In Odzala-Kokoua National Park (Congo), group size was usually &gt;20 (Maisels 1996). In Ituri (DRC), it was 24 (Kambale Saambili 1999), in Ngotto Forest (CAR) it was 20 (D. Brugière, pers. comm. 2013). Groups of 50–200 have been observed in southeast Cameroon (Usongo and Fimbel 1995), northeast Gabon (Quris 1975) and northeast DRC (Kambale Saambili 1999).</p>","<p><em>Cercocebus agilis</em><strong> </strong>is hunted throughout its range for bushmeat and sometimes persecuted for crop raiding. Because these monkeys spend a fair proportion of time on the ground, they are vulnerable to snaring – a method of hunting used throughout its geographic range. Snares are usually set for forest antelopes and rodents, but can catch any terrestrial animal.<br/><br/>At the western, northern and eastern edges of its range, this species is threatened by habitat loss caused by deforestation for timber and firewood. An analysis of forest loss suggests that 1.3% of the forest in its range was lost between 2001 and 2016 (13,368 km²&#160;of the 1 million km² range). However, because this taxon occurs primarily along rivers, this may be an underestimate of the true loss of habitat, as forest loss in the savanna-forest mosaic will be concentrated along rivers and galleries.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Few data exist on abundance relative to human pressure, but even in 1996, in the more westerly part of its range (Lobéké NP, Cameroon), the abundance of <em>C. agilis</em> was an order of magnitude lower than the smaller-bodied, sympatric guenons at that site, and it was recorded only at distances of over 20 km from a road (an indicator of high hunting pressure), whereas smaller-bodied primate species still occurred close to the road (WCS unpublished data 1996). In the most easterly part of its range, in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, encounter rates on surveys declined by an order of magnitude (WCS unpublished data 2018) over the last decade. This is attributed to increased hunting pressure, due to easier access along a much-improved main road, to the influx of large numbers of people into the area for artisanal mining, and to ongoing civil unrest in eastern DRC.</p><p>Densities of Agile Mangabeys appear to be highly variable, presumably influenced by both habitat type and hunting pressure. Population density in Gabon has been recorded at between 6.7 and 12.5 individuals/km² (Quris 1975). At Mondika in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (Congo), density was 6.9 individuals/km²&#160;(Shah 2003). In Odzala-Kokoua National Park (Congo), group size was usually at least 20, and there were between 0.5 and 2 groups/km²&#160;(10–40 animals/km²), depending on the habitat type (Maisels 1996). In the Ituri Forest (DRC), densities varied between 2 individuals/km²&#160;(Thomas 1991) and 38 individuals/km²&#160;(Kambale Saambili 1998). In the Ngotto Forest (CAR), densities varied between 7.2 and 41 individuals/km²&#160;– variation here was related to hunting intensity by humans (D. Brugière pers. comm. 2013).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The&#160;geographic&#160;range of&#160;<em style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"">Cercocebus agilis</em>&#160;is not well known, despite covering about 1,010,000&#160;km².&#160;This species occurs&#160;in Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), northeast Gabon and northern&#160;Republic of&#160;Congo. It remains to be confirmed whether it still occurs in Equatorial Guinea.</p><p>The most westerly subpopulation, which may be isolated, appears to be in Campo Ma’an in southern Cameroon, as recorded by three different surveys (Etoga and Foguekem 2008, 2009; Nzooh Dongmo 2015).

East of 22°&#160;E, the northern limit is likely around 6°&#160;45’ N across to about 30°E, including the area of DRC southwards to at least the Tshopo River.<br/><br/>The southern limit is the right bank of the Congo River, probably from its confluence with the Tshopo (J.

The range is then limited by the southwestern edge of the swamp forests (around 0°18’S up to just south of Odzala National Park (NP) at about 0°30’ S, and continues westwards across Gabon to Cameroon – west of the Dja Biosphere Reserve, near Sangemelima at around 11°30’ E (Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. 1999).</p>","<span class=""msoIns"">This species is hunted throughout its range for bushmeat.",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Cercocebus agilis</em><strong> </strong>is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

The Zanzibar Red Colobus is not territorial and lives in multi-male groups, with a mean of 17.1 individuals per group. Mean group sizes are significantly higher in protected areas (20.6) than outside (12.8) (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2019). Young leaves and leaf buds account for more than 50% of the diet. In forest-dwelling groups, unripe fruit accounts for an additional quarter of the diet, whereas for groups living in agricultural areas, leaves from herbaceous species are the second most eaten item (approximately 15% of the annual diet). Some groups feed on mangrove leaves, and populations on coral rag appear to subsist on a drier, coarser diet than recorded for any other red colobus (Siex 2003).</p>","<p>The species is increasingly threatened by habitat destruction from agricultural expansion, human development, timber felling and charcoal production. Forest destruction in protected areas remains a problem. Since the eradication of the Zanzibar Leopard, humans have been the main predator.

Cliffs, hills or large trees are necessary night-time retreats. In some habitats, such as in the Namib Desert, habitat choice is influenced by predation risk. This species is totally dependent on drinking daily, and water availability limits its overall range in Namibia. However, one troop in the Kuiseb Canyon, Namib Desert, balanced its water requirements with moisture from nearby plants and conserved water by resting and sleeping during the hottest part of the day. Through this adaptation to their arid environment they temporarily overcame restrictions imposed by the need for regular drinking and were observed to survive without water for up to 11 days and even longer. In dry localities, artificial water supplies have allowed substantial expansion of territory. This species is an opportunistic omnivore and shows a local preference for bulbs, shoots, roots, seeds or fruits. Invertebrates, small vertebrates, seashore life, fungi and lichen are eaten as and when available. Occasionally, they take small antelopes or the young of species like Impala <em>Aepyceros melampus</em>. Crops (maize, tomatoes, citrus and root crops) are raided in settled areas.

Between 1975 and 2013, the range countries of Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria have experienced an extensive (25-58%) loss of forest (CILSS 2016) and between 2000 and 2012 protected areas in three range countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria) have seen a significant (4.0-6.7 % per annum) decline of forested areas (Spracklen <em>et al.</em> 2015). The high degrees of threat that this species is facing justify upgrading its threat status by two categories compared to the 2008 assessment.","<p>Found in lowland rainforest, swamp forests, semi-deciduous forests and in gallery forests in the savanna zone. At Kikélé Forest in Benin, Djègo-Djossou <em>et al.</em> (2015) report that the diet of an habituated group consisted of 60.3% leaves, 33.3% fruits, 6.4% other items (seeds, flowers and&#160; tree bark). At Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary (BFMS) in Ghana, the species is reported to eat mainly leaves of trees and lianas, along with a small quantity of fruits and seedpods (Kankam and Sicotte 2013). &#160;The Kikélé fissioned into two groups in 2018, one of which contains two adult males in a group of 19 individuals, while the other contains one adult male and one adult female (R. Chabi Ota pers. comm.). At BFMS and in Bia National Park (Ghana), groups were either one-male or multi-male and average group size was between 10 and 15 (range 3–38); home-range size varies between 11 ha and 48 ha (Wong &amp; Sicotte 2006). Groups encountered during surveys in Togo in 2014-2015 varied in size between 4 and 20 (Segniagbeto <em>et al.</em> 2017) while surveys in Kwabre Swamp Forest found small groups of between 3 and 5 (Danquah and Tetteh 2016).</p>","<em>Colobus vellerosus</em> is threatened primarily by hunting and secondarily by habitat loss (McGraw 2005). Accelerated hunting pressure is discernible from reported changes in hunters’ behaviour in the species’ range countries. Thirty years ago, hunters in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire almost always hunted only larger-bodied animals, but now they are mostly hunting smaller-bodied animals because of the depletion of large primates like <em>C. vellerosus</em> (Decher and Kpelle 2005, Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2016). The region the species inhabits has a dense and rapidly growing human population; forest destruction and fragmentation have been extensive, and the hunting of wildlife is uncontrolled in most places, although at several sites the monkeys are held sacred (e.g., Kikélé sacred forest in Benin, Dinaoudi sacred grove in Côte d’Ivoire, Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana). Even in sacred groves, however, the future of this species is uncertain, because traditional beliefs are no longer well respected and habitat degradation is ongoing (S. Gonedelé Bi pers. obs. 2014). In both Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, more than half of the closed forest in the forest reserves has been converted to plantation or farmland, or cleared and left bare (Bitty <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Comoé National Park in Côte d’Ivoire, several groups remain, but hunting pressure and mining occur although some patrol is in place. At the border of Benin and Togo, the proposed construction of the 147MW Adjarala storage hydropower station on the Mono River is threatening the future of this species in the Togodo protected area; approximately 2,315 hectares of the forest will be submerged under water","<p>In Côte d’Ivoire, surveys conducted in the last three decades indicate that <em>Colobus vellerosus</em> has been extirpated from almost all the protected areas where it formerly occurred (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al.</em> 2012) except the Comoé National Park in the northeast where several groups were observed in December 2018–January 2019 (S. Gonedelé Bi and R. Matsuda Goodwin pers. comm. 2019). This species also occurs in a community forest (Tanoé-Ehy swamp forest) and two sacred groves (Dinaoudi and Grébouo 1). In Tanoé-Ehy, a few groups were observed (S. Gonedelé Bi, pers. obs. 2018). In Dinaoudi and Grébouo 1, not more than 45 individuals in total remain.</p><p>In Ghana, more than 50% of protected areas that contained <em>C. vellerosus</em> in the 1970s no longer contain it. There has been on the average 87% reduction in encounter rates of this species in six forest reserves in the last 30 years, suggesting an equivalent reduction in population size. On the other hand, Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary and its surroundings were home to 365 individuals in 2007 (Kankam and Sicotte 2013). Although no systematic census has been conducted since then, this population appears to be stable, while at least two groups of this species survive in Kakum National Park where law enforcement has been strengthened in the last 10 years (Wiafe 2016). Danquah and Tetteh’s (2016) survey in the Kwabre swamp forest in the southwest of the country in February 2009 reported the average encounter rates of 1.5 group/km (logged areas) and 1 group/km (unlogged areas) for <em>C. vellerosus</em>, but R. Horwich (pers. comm. 2015) reported that the species became much scarcer in recent years. In Mole National Park, the relative abundance of the species reported by patrol guards shows a 69% decline between 2001 and 2006 (Burton 2010). The continued occurrence of this species at Bui and Digya National Parks is uncertain given the fact that the former has been extremely deforested and there is no evidence of the bushmeat of this species sold in the markets near the latter park.</p><p>In Togo, this species occurs in Togodo protected area near the Benin-Togo border, Fazao-Malfakassa National Park, and the Yikpa-Dzigbe community forest where a few small groups at each site were observed; it has been extirpated from Missahohe (Kpalime), Assime Forest and Assoukoko forest (Segniagbeto <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>In Benin, a habituated group of about 18 individuals and another unhabituated group of three individuals live in Kikelé sacred grove; the Lama forest has one group consisting of 10-15 individuals.

Its current distribution is extremely fragmented and within the Bandama-Sassandra interfluvial zone in Côte d'Ivoire, Grébouo 1 sacred forest is the only site where this species still occurs (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2014). A few local biologists and forest rangers have recently reported that this species still occurs in the Old Oyo National Park and Opara Game Reserve in western Nigeria (Kazeem 2017), but this needs verification. A subpopulation that was once located between the Bandama and Sassandra Rivers, and sometimes referred to the subspecies <em>dollmani</em>, probably represented a hybrid zone with <em>C. polykomos</em> (Oates &amp; McGraw 2009). Recent surveys in this interfluvial region indicate that “<em>dollmani</em>” has been extirpated and that the remaining population of the black-and-white colobus in that area is more similar to <em>C. vellerosus,</em> based on pelage patterns (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Subsistence hunting for bushmeat occurs for this species (national rather than international commercial value).,Terrestrial,"<em>C. vellerosus</em> is listed as Class A under the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and under Appendix II of CITES. Range countries should enact tougher laws against the hunting of threatened species and strictly enforce them. In order to more accurately grasp the size and density of populations of this species, systematic surveys should be conducted in Mole NP, Digya NP, Atewa FR in Ghana, and Old Oyo NP, Opara Game Reserve, and Kainji Lake NP in Nigeria. Currently, the <em>Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Côte d’Ivoire</em> (Swiss Centre for Scientific Research)(CSRS) and the <em>Action pour la Conservation de la Biodiversité Côte d'Ivoire</em> (ACB-CI) in Côte d’Ivoire, and West African Primate Conservation Action (WAPCA) in Ghana have initiated conservation efforts for <em>C. vellerosus</em> and other threatened primates in Tanoé-Ehy Community Forest in Côte d’Ivoire and in the nearby Kwabre Forest in Ghana by involving local communities (Koné 2015). CSRS and ACB-CI are also currently conducting surveys in the Comoé National Park. In Togo, the Togolese Association for Nature Conservation (AGBO-ZEGUE) is making an effort to contribute to the preservation of the habitats of the species in Togodo National Park (G. Segniagbeto pers. comm. 2016). We recommend developing primate tourism in the Kikélé Forest (Benin) and Comoé National Park (Côte d’Ivoire).

A decline exceeding 50% of the population is estimated for a time period that includes both the past and future (three generations; 30 years) based on past reduced density and encounter rates, reduction in area of occupancy, and reduction in habitat quality, and the threats have not ceased. Red colobus monkeys are poorly adapted to habitat degradation and their populations have been completely extirpated from several forests outside protected areas due to habitat degradation and loss. If as expected these processes continue, then all populations outside protected areas will likely be lost in the near future. Furthermore, substantial population declines have been documented in some parts of Kibale National Park and Gombe Stream National Park due to predation by Chimpanzees, with up to 89% declines recorded in group encounter rates. The vast majority of <em>Piliocolobus tephrosceles</em> reside in one location – Kibale National Park. Given that it's survival depends on a single location, the future of this taxon is tenuous, especially as there is already a high level of predation by Chimpanzees in some parts of this park.</p><p></p>","This species occurs in a wide variety of forest types, including riverine and gallery forest, forest-miombo savanna mosaic, old-growth lowland, mid-altitude, and montane moist rain forest, degraded secondary forests, and raphia palm swamps (Struhsaker 2010, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013).<br/><br/>In Kibale, <em>P. tephrosceles </em>is most abundant in moist, old-growth, evergreen forest with emergent trees reaching 50 m in height (Struhsaker 2010, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, and references therein). It can persist in lightly logged forest as long as important food trees remain (Lee <em>et al</em>. 1988). Groups of <em>P. tephrosceles </em>average about 45–50 individuals in Kibale, and 55–59 individuals in Gombe (Struhsaker 2010, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, and references therein). The mean group size recorded in Mbizi was 41 and in Mbuzi, 34 (Davenport <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2007).","<p>The main threat to <em>P. tephrosceles </em>is habitat loss through selective logging of mature forest for timber, conversion to agricultural land, the production of charcoal, and forest fires. To some degree, hunting for meat and skins remains a threat (e.g., around Mbizi; Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2007). The taxon also appears to be heavily predated by Chimpanzees. At Ngogo in Kibale National Park, the Colobus Monkeys live with the largest community of Chimpanzees recorded anywhere, which form huge hunting parties that result in the highest hunting success rate known for any large vertebrate predator (Struhsaker 2010). The population in Gombe Stream National Park appears to be seriously threatened with extinction because of predation by Chimpanzees and because of the very small size (<em>ca </em>80 km²) and isolation of Gombe (Struhsaker 2005).<br/></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","<em>Piliocolobus tephrosceles</em> numbers at least 20,000 animals, with the largest and most viable population in Kibale National Park in Uganda estimated at ≥17,000 (Struhsaker 2005). Approximately 60% of the Kibale National Park represents suitable habitat for red colobus and published density estimates in this habitat range from 93 to 313 individuals/km² (Struhsaker 2005). Although Kibale would appear to have a healthy and viable population, long-term studies in two areas of the park indicate statistically significant declines in Ashy Red Colobus numbers. In one of them—the Ngogo study area—census data spanning nearly 33 years indicate an 89% decline in group encounter rates (Lwanga <em>et al</em>. 2011), mainly due to predation by Chimpanzees (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>). A similar long-term study focusing on the effects of logging and spanning 28 years at the Kanyawara study site, also in Kibale, indicated a 40% decline in Ashy Red Colobus numbers in old growth and protected forest, as well as in nearby selectively logged forest (Chapman <em>et al</em>. 2000). Red Colobus density in forest fragments on the western boundary of Kibale averaged 2.1 animals per hectare and ranged from 0 to 8.33 animals/ha (Chapman <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, a more recent assessment found that many of those fragments have either been eliminated or degraded by human activities and that the Red Colobus populations in them declined by 83% between 2000 and 2010 (Chapman <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Ashy Red Colobus numbers in Gombe Stream National Park also seem to have declined due to predation by Chimpanzees. Red Colobus group sizes have declined by nearly 50% over a 25-year period (Stanford 1998) and 16–40% of them are killed each year by Chimpanzees (Wrangham and Bergmann-Riss 1990).",Decreasing,"<p><em>Piliocolobus tephrosceles </em>is present on the eastern border of the Rift Valley in western Uganda and western Tanzania (Struhsaker and Grubb 2013).

However, recent surveys in Misheta found little forest of any consequence left in the area, and the Red Colobus population there has is probably been extirpated (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2007). A subpopulation subsequently recorded in a forest patch near the village of Nsangu (post the surveys by Rodgers <em>et al</em>. 1984) is probably also now extinct (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2007). Davenport <em>et al</em>. (2007) reported a new and previously unrecorded population of <em>P. tephrosceles </em>in Mbuzi forest. They also surveyed the Chala forest, which was in poor condition; no primates were seen, although it is not known if Red Colobus ever existed there.

Long-term monitoring of the Ngogo subpopulation is required, as well as a comprehensive, long-term monitoring programme for the colobus throughout Kibale, as Kibale is the last hope for conservation of this taxon. <br/><br/>The southernmost population in the Mbizi forest should be protected, as this is the only remaining montane forest of any size in Ufipa, and the only source of water for Sumbawanga’s growing human population.

The following are density estimates in different sites: 14.6 ind/km² and 24.11 ind/km² in Carauari, AM; 0.71 ind/km² in Coarí, AM; 6.84 ind/km² in Tefé, AM; 6.73 ind./km² in Sena Madureira, AC (Peres 1988a); 8.62 ind/km² in FLOES do Antimary, AC and 8.95 ind/km² in Fazenda Bela Esperança, AC (Calouro 2005); 1.38 ind/km² and 8.18 ind/km² in Lago Mamori, AM and 6.61 ind/km² (Vulinec <em>et al</em>. 2006); 0.19 groups/10 km survey TI Campinas/Katukina (Calouro 2007), 0.27 groups/10 km survey Reserva Florestal Humaitá (Botelho <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This is a wide-ranging species in the lower Amazon. The species is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>","<p>The species is hunted for food and for pets (among the most common primate kept as pets). The release of pet monkeys back into the wild is another threat for these primates (Martinez <em>et al., </em>2000). Such releases must be considered in terms of the level of risk of disease transmission and hybridization. In Peru, Aquino and Encarnación (1994) reported that hunting has led to its extirpation in areas around human settlements. The species is affected by illegal trade. In local markets in Amazonian Ecuador, a capuchin monkey could be sold in US$20-50 (J. Olalla pers. comm.).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.
